"no doubt about it.  this book covers the history of the border patrol.  however, it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a ""fluff piece"" than anything else.    as someone who has not only served as a senior border patrol agent (13 years) but also a border patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency, i have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job (many say a necessity).  pacheco, as an active agent (when he wrote the book at least), appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target.  his somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line (i apologize for the pun) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial.  did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed?  if so, then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else.  if he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint, then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the border patrol and border security.      simply put, the border patrol, as with most of the homeland security subcomponents is disintegrating.  remember the incompetence of fema (a homeland security subcomponent)?  well, multiply that incompetence times ten.  heard about the poor morale of fema employees?  multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the border patrol.  a border patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out.  those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in dhs.  the bottom line is that as a former agent, i lose sleep at night knowing what i know.       pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda.  that alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of u.s. border patrol agent.  the field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits.      read the book for enjoyment and homage.  just don't expect critical analysis.  in fact, this book would be an enjoyable read at stewarts bridge (for you ib agents in san diego). good history, but......."	2
there's a ton of paper in this book, overboard, in my opinion. wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious.  i've taken quite a few of the sierra hikes and the information hasn't been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail. they miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation. i think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in california. refinement needed	2

a book full of heartwarming stories from country stars, singers, writers,  and listeners, or so the back of the book said.  as i read some sentimental  stories, and some down right boring stories i questioned how more than half  of these stories got into the `country1 edition of the chicken soup series.   i loved about three stories, liked about ten, and was puzzled by all the  other entries. what was country about the majority of the stories????	2
this joke book suks. if i can give it any star i want, i would give it a -10 stars. i never actually bought it, but i borrowed it from a friend. i needed a joke book for my anouncements on the intercom every morning, and it only lasted 3 days and i ran out of good jokes. some of the jokes arnt appropriate and most of them dont make sense. if your gonna buy a joke book, dont buy this. suks comepletely	0

"do you feel different from people around you?  do they resent your ingenuity?  have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs?  do you long for the company of others like yourself, who, tragically but inevitably, are biologically destined to wipe these shorter, darker subhumans from the face of the earth?  congratulations!  you are either in the aryan nations or the clan of the cave bear fan club, possibly both!    (i exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century english settler in australia, or a boer in south africa, or maybe you just like larry niven, but that's beside the point)    i can forgive auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book.  in the late 1970's when she did her research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at wikipedia.  ultimately we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion.    similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected her editor.  i haven't read her more recent works, but i imagine she has probably improved.  even with the pendulous sentences clan is not unreadable.    what infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged.  the story reads like a near-literal historicization of helena blavatsky's secret doctrine on the fall of the ""aryans""- who interbred with ""subhumans"" introducing the world to, oh i dunno, domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture.  of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed ayla is innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug.    against this master narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression.  i would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet, and give auel's books a wide berth.    also?  enough rape scenes already. are we not the supermen?  super duper supermen?"	0
"i loved the first carole matthews novel i read, ""for better or worse"", and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again. it kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight, but only because i didnt' have anything else to do. i am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane.      i totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless. there were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning. to me, matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her. i think this is a horrible/unrealistic messgage.     if you want to read something good, pick up a jane green novel instead. don't waste your time or money......."	0

i'm new at reading about energy healing modalities, so i have little to compare it to.  i found this book to be a really nice book to learn more about healing touch and how to be a practitioner.  it has some wonderful stories, some that even made me cry.  i still have a long way to go to make this work for me, but it's the beginning of a new awareness in my life. wonderful handbook	1
"robert putnam's book bemoans the declne in ""civic participation"" among americans since its heyday in the 50's and 60's.  although few would argue that bridge clubs aren't what they used to be, who would have predicted the rise of 20,000 member mega-churches back in 1962?  this underlines the basic problem with this book: it focuses too much on what constituted ""communities"" and ""activities"" in the past, without looking at how people form new and different kinds of communities today.  while i agree that television has dramatically increased the couch potato index, and participation in traditional formal organizations has declined, i would argue that membership and participation in new kinds of groups that are more relevant to people in the 21st century has risen.  for example, while young people famously are less likely to vote in our dual-party system, college students today volunteer more that any generation before them.  in addition, while participation in mainline protestant churches has stedily declined, engagement in evangelical churches has risen dramatically.  while i personally feel that the sterile suburban, drive-everywhere-in-my-suv existance is soul crushing, and the popularity of reality tv may be a sign of the apocolypse, i also don't pine for the days where mom was expected to stay home with the kids and go to the bridge club once a week, while dad worked 9-5, returned home to supper, and went to the men's club on tuesdays at 8.  and while putnam's basic premise may resonate with many, its fetishization of days past blunts the strength of his overall argument. um, the 50's are over..."	2
and when didn't buy a new edition and i got out from behind my computer and started making cold calls, i got published. i know the pain of writing for so very long with no recognition. all i can say is that maybe this book can make you feel better temporarily, thinking you have some kind of inside track that nobody else has (lol), but the only way to get published is to make your own inside track. this book won't help you do it. i bought every edition of this book for 5 years	0
alan shepard was the first american man in space - this occured on may 5th, 1961 with john f. kennedy in office.  i find it amazing that it took 43 long years to finally get some semblence of the affair in writing.  well, like the old saying goes - better late than never.  author, neal thompson did an excellent job of explaining the growing up years of one of the most famous aviators in the world, alan b. shepard.  he was courageous enough to print the truth about the man who was supremely confident in his physical as well as intellectual abilities.  but all great men have their downfalls, as is well-documented in this book.  the first man in space may have only been up there for 15 minutes, but it was this brief shining moment of accurate performing that launched the legend that is alan shepard.  he conquered meniere's disease by having to first conquer and overcome his (bogus) christian science faith - - - and - - - no surprise, he was cured under the famous healing hand of dr. house in los angeles.    i was intrigued to discover he almost commanded apollo 13, but was reassigned to the next mission instead, due to preparation contingencies.  this decision saved shepard the near-disasterous mission that we know occured on apollo 13 - what a close call! shepard always did display this lucky streak that never stopped.  he also might have been up on apollo 1 - but his ear problem started around that time and he was grounded.  it's as if a higher power was looking out for him and doing creative things to keep shepard alive and well.  his ride was on apollo 14; he was the commander and he did another perfect job, what else is new?  what else did we expect from alan shepard?  his wife, louise stood by his side, in good times and in bad for 50 years - she had a lot of competition out there with the rocket groupies.  not to mention the stress of living with a high risk occupation. but he always managed to call her at 5:00pm most nights, except for those times he was staying at the apollo motel # 14.  this book was so interesting and mesmerizing - i read it non-stop for 2 days.....all 399 pages of it.  i could not put it down - i even drug it to work with me today.  there are some nice photographs in there, but i would like to see about 1000 more of the life and times of alan shepard.  some people are born to live lives of extreme risk, challenge  and unbelievable success.....and the rest of us can only imagine what it must have felt like to be in their shoes.  shepard's life was very exciting indeed, and i wonder why on earth did it take 43 years for this wonderful book to be published?  the truth may be a painful and bitter thing to taste, but it's the way things panned out in real life.  they had a huge ego and they stroked that ego one times too many.  why do risk takers take so many risks?  well, i suppose it comes with the territory of being a risk taker in the first place.  today ---all of our famous apollo astronaughts are aging; many have passed on to the big rocket ship in the sky, so reading about these incredible men and the incredible lives they lived is a real treat for all persons who wonder about such immense challenges.  it is my sincere hope that all of them have books published about their biographies...they have lived and dared to fulfill outrageous dreams.  they are what make this country great in the eyes of the universe.  before long, the apollo moon walkers will be gone from the face of this beautiful blue earth.  we need to know them - at least by biographies - we need to hear thier stories and understand their feelings before their ultimate count-down to zero is counted.  please read this book!  it's an excellent book!  it's the year 2004 and i can now say i know alot more about this man that held the facination of millions.....alan shepard - he was a great man who did great things, and lived life to the fullest possible. 43 years later, we get to know the man, al shepard.	1
godel's theorem has been entirely overused!  lets get one thing straight people: all that theorem says is that in any decently powerful formal system you are forced to decide between either have a complete but inconsistent system, or have an incomplete but consistent system!  it has no relevance to ai, so go find some other argument to bolster your bio-bigotry. please... leave godel alone!	0
"as a matter of fact martin zweig is one of the few phds who's ""able"" to explain even somewhat complicated subjects in plain words. the same thing can't be said about the contemporary authors of various market, finance or economics books published over the last years.       hands down, this is one of the best and one of the most (again)  simple books ever written on wall street. it provided me with new insights on different aspects of trading and economics in general, like the four percent model indicator, the monetary model, the mutual funds cash/assets ratio, the three crucial conditions for bear markets. there were also other brief and concise ideas which seem to stand the test of time, like ""it's ok to monitor the crowd and go against it, but you only want to do so when the crowd is extremely one-sided"", ""recognizing the relationship between trends and the industries that might benefit from them can lead to above normal returns"", ""if you could just eliminate the worst 10% of all stocks and choose even randomly from the rest, you would certainly beat the market"". and the most surprising of them all (at least to me): ""there seems to be some inborn reasoning in wall street that better profits mean higher stock prices, but this simply is not true in aggregate. the best gains made in bull markets tend to come in the first six months of a fresh bull market, when profits are usually declining"".       but when it comes to the brass tacks of his methodology, i think the best part of this book is the one about scanning the financial section. his method of picking the winners by simply checking the latest quarterly figures in company sales and earnings in the daily financial section of the wall street journal or the new york times and the process he goes through afterwards, until deciding in the end which ones to buy is simple, yet very powerful.       i don't know why, but almost every single page of this book reminded me of the legendary jesse livermore and his valuable and immortal lessons. after reading m. zweig's book you'll never invest the same way as before. ""winning on wall street"" is an intelligent and insightful investing book, yet simple to understand. rather than trying to razzle-dazzle the reader, this book explains why it is so important to stick to simple concepts and rules such as "" buy strength and sell weakness, stay in gear with the tape, the trend is your friend, etc""; rules you have read and heard about a gazillion times before, but which are so easy to violate! as a trader once said: ""the market is the train, so be the caboose"". a phd who deserves the respect he gets"	1

"f this self-help industry crap. quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. i can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. humans are far more complex than the hack man-warrior/female-maiden title what's-his-name gives them. and remember, this ""doctor,"" is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. that's a great start to a sane life. women are from vaginas and men are too"	0
much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. sadly, from reading some of the reviews on amazon, mr. hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit florida after reading mr. hiaasen's books. this is sad- that  people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like twilly spree, clinton skink tyree and palmer stoat. where does he get these names? during my 25 years in florida, the people i met  had names like robert, jim, mary, chris, michael, etc. by the way, for those of you who think i am just a floridian with sour grapes- i have been a proud resident of the northeast for over 20 years. i just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. it causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. read some christopher moore for your humor fix. he doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun. stereotypes and unbelievable storyline	2

"robert allen is one of the many real estate ""gurus"" in the world who probably makes more money selling you the ""secrets"" to real estate then actually practicing his own advice.  i have noticed that people either hate his stuff or love it.  i am guessing those who love his stuff haven't actually tried to do it.    the book has a lot of wealth building ideas, but many of them are dangerous to the beginning investor and really require a lot of experience and knowledge to pull off successfully, which is not the typical reader of his books.  he is looking for the person who needs to find the ""magic bullet"" for easy wealth and success, but unfortunately you won't find any magic bullets or fantastic money making secrets in this book.  what you will find is a bunch of average ideas that are painted with a very deceptive picture of how much work, money, and experience you actually need to be successful.    he spends a lot of time discussing real estate investing, which is where he got his start, but a beginning investor should understand that what he teaches is hard, takes a lot of time, and requires experience.  you will probably need some of your own money and will need to have good skills in sales, marketing, construction, and general business.  some of the actual investing ideas are ok, but not easily and it certainly not without a lot of work, which will exclude a lof of people.    he also offers advice on investing in rare coins and while i know individuals who do this and some actually make a lot of money doing it most people should understand that doing this requires   a lot of experience and knowledge and it not an investment that should be undertaken without a lot of information.    overall his ideas are average, but they require a lot of work and information and in many cases your own money to truly make them work.  if you can take any of one of his ideas and make a lot of money doing it you will definately earn it through the amount of hard work, knowledge learned, and experience you must earn.  it will not be as easy as mr. allen makes it out to be and will definately take more time then he suggests.    if you already do some of the types of investing he discusses and you know what you are getting into then you could read the book for a few average ideas but you won't get much more from it. not realistic"	2
i tried many times to finish this book because once i buy it and start it, i hate to just walk away from it. but, this book did it. i was never really interested in the plot, i thought the writing was very basic, elementary actually, slow, and just plain boring. i tried on more than one occasion to pick it back up, but i never did get into to, making this the only book i've ever started and put back on my shelf with no interest in finishing. couldn't finish it...	0

not only has this professor studied the country of iraq, he has studied its language and its history.  unlike many authors writing about iraq, he has lived there.  he was also a policy advisor during the kennedy administration.  given this, he has a better perspective than most who have written about it.    in highlighting linguistics, polk points out that not understanding the language will inevitably lead to misunderstanding, which will in turn lead to bad decisions.  further, by highlighting the history of the country, he underlines the good times and the bad, and in doing so, he points out what is likely to happen.    the last part of the book discusses the current situation in iraq and the united states' involvement.  here, the author applies the history and language to show what can be expected.  however, part of this also goes into critique.    regardless on your take of the united states' presence in iraq, this book is a good primer for understanding iraq. solid foundation and background	2
i am so sorry i hadn't taken the time to read the customer's reviews of made in america and the lost continent, prior to buying them.  frankly, i'm not sure which of these two books is more disappointing.  the only thing i was able to take away from them was the idea that bill bryson thinks hammering and bashing anything north american (usa only) is considered extremely good fun and humorous. made in america	0
"well in my opinion, there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies, and some people have had some unusual experiences (mostly disturbing, but some apparrently enlightening), but the question is, is it all as it seems?  the fact of the matter is, various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us.  holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys (this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events); there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario; advanced, drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now (verichip).  i'm not saying that other lifeforms don't exist in the universe (far from it), and perhaps there are a number of entities here on earth carrying out agendas, but this idea that there are little, menacing greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense collusion seems suspect.  it smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us.  historically, there's been the barbarians, huns, mongols,  pagans, jews, christians, vikings, black natives, cannabals, red natives, mexicans, germans, nazis, communists, now the arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on earth.  even president reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80's.  the fact is that with known technology (not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked), they could quite easily pull the hoax off.  even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and practiced (albeit ""underground"") than most people can fathom.  what has become another fact is the major extent to which the ufo community has been infiltrated and compromised, of which strieber has been front and centre at various times.  my belief is that strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign, sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups.  in this book, his ""hard-evidence"" is flimsey and suspicious.  for example, why wouldn't super advanced aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue (thus not showing up on any x-ray, mri, ct, etc)?  and design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body?  surely, this would be child's play for alien scientists?  why no major discussion or mention of the human military, or nazi connection with abductions?  there seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange ""fragments"" of memories that are slipping through various memory covers.  why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the greys?  why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms?  why are some speaking english, others german?  why is there a connection with deep, underground bases and specifically antartica?  these are things strieber never mentions, which i find curious.  my point is, things are happening, but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what, and strieber's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas. agenda here?"	2
i am one of those who loves booknotes and book-tv and feels a real loss when my schedule keeps me away from them (yes, i can pick them up on the c-span websites, but it just isn't quite the same).  these books are just one of the additional reasons some of us refer to brian lamb as saint brian.  the chapters are digests of the information gleaned during the actual booknotes broadcasts.  each one is from an individual author and in this case, it is on the lives of famous americans.    there are something like 80 to 85 of these biographical vignettes.  some of them are autobiographical when the author being interviewed about their book was also a notable american in their own right.  we all know mr. lamb's unique style of quantum interviewing (one can never predict the precise location of his next question).  these edited and assembled pieces have a somewhat more organized and focused feel, but there is still a bit of the cooks tour approach to each subject.    having watched many of the shows from which these articles were made and also having read several of the books by these authors, i can still say that even when the material here is familiar it is still fun to dash through because it is so concisely presented and decently edited.  when the material is unfamiliar it is very delightful and an invitation to more study and investigation.    i am not only happy to have this dandy book, i am actually grateful for it.  it is a marvelous tool for introducing children to biographical subjects!    the book also has an index and a list of all the booknotes programs through the publishing date of the book. what a great teaching tool - nice biographical vignettes	1
"american lives.  hannity receives his talking points every day from the rnc, and then repeats them like the summoner from ""canterbury tales,"" repeating his two or three latin phrases.  hannity's phrases:  - liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.    - liberals don't want to defend america and fought homeland security every step of the way (when it was bush who fought it)    - howard dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is hillary, al gore, john kerry, and every republican except for ben nelson and joe lieberman.    - osama bin laden was offered up to clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)    so, as al franken says, hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.    don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  he is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs. hannity and this book are an example of nonthinking"	0
"i'm not a fan of psychologists as protagonists in mysteries and i'm even less interested when they deal with children. children in peril is not entertaining. that said, however, i picked up ""rage"" at the airport. and thus, my first jonathan kellerman novel.    this was a dumb story and far from believable. i could not suspend disbelief. if you read mysteries, the bad guy screams ""it's me! it's me!"" in the first 30 pages. i was hoping i was wrong, but unfortunately, that was not the case. so, i tagged along and watched alex and milo chase obvious red herrings, useless leads, eat some donuts, theorize and solve the mystery!  i cannot mention how bad i thought the story was without giving away the plot, but let's just say that the antagonists and their behavior is just not believeable over the course of so many years.     i'll try an earlier j. kellerman book. maybe it will be better. my first j. kellerman novel. i'll try another one, but..."	0
greene has clearly drawn out the ways of the seducer.  most of the men and women in here are naturals at seduction and are not consciously doing the principles taught.  but those that tend to mess up their seductions can learn quite a few things from these people.  with everything i teach at my site the seduction bible, i still believe that this book is excellent for those looking to score that one special girl.  those wanting to learn how to go out to a bar to pick up a woman are better off on sites like mine.  but this book deserves 5 stars. yes it is an art!	1
although most of modern day america will not want to hear the research this book relates, it is fascinating - a little infuriating, and very interesting.  the facts and information presented on our health care system and mostly about our standard american diet have led me to a complete diet change - and i feel great now!  i also know i'm doing what is best for my body.  the book is easy to read and understandable even with the research statistics.  i would encourage anyone who is interested in their health to read this, but be warned - you may not like what you learn. what you don't know is hurting you	1
"this book is amazing. it explains every energy principle before explaing how to use it. it gives the necessary understanding for both left brained and right brained people. personally, it gave me the missing piece about manifesting: how to eliminate the inner ""chat"" or ""noise"" that prevented me from focusing in what i wanted. it is an excellent reference bor beginners and advanced reality manifestors.    it also gave me many advanced techniques for creating and manifesting thoughts in an easy to understand language but yet in a very inspiring and powerful way.    i have a big pile of excelent resources on the topic, but i definetely need to give an standing ovation to ""professional dreamer"". it is really a must. the results are astounding. bravo!"	1

this was my first jance novel and probably my last. i am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. many false assertions regarding the catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in new mexico as if it was a known fact. the most offensive reference being that god clearly must be a woman. do not buy from this author if morally conservative. zero stars if there was an option!!	0

as a designer in the new york metropolitan area, i thoroughly appreciate the effort that must have gone into making this book, and in particular its illustrations. they are detailed, accurate (as far as i can tell), and above all informative in a way that infrastructure diagrams from other books are not. it is noted that tw:aoac's lead designer found inspiration in a chance encounter with famed statistician/graphic artist edward tufte - a credible claim, if this book is any indicator. conveying so much about the city yet basking in white space, these spreads are consistently excellent. ascher's writing, too, is impeccable, and while a free-market standpoint is appropriately engaged in her commentary, the invaluabity of new york's public bureaus is not given short shrift.  indeed, where politics have clouded issues of development for the city, ms. ascher has deftly surmised the issue and given it full and fair treatment. as a major in economics and a professional graphic designer, i am happily forced to recommend this book. spectacular!	1

it seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of lucas davenport.  i feel that he wants to transplant the best of davenport to a new hero.if so, he failed.    if that is the case, he failed. there are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us.    worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. how sad.. a pale copy	2
got this when it came out and gave it a read. three years have passed and i just referred to it to support writing a paper on technology. the details are good and the higher level dialogue do a nice job of getting the message across without belaboring anything. if you are about the web and doing business, this is worth the bucks and time. remains solid	1
i enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts, but i didn't even make it through the first chapter before i put this book down in disgust. almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments. as i was flipping through the book, i found x-rated pictures and drawings that i would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book. i never would have bought this book if i had seen it in a bookstore, and i regret throwing it in the trash before i could see if i could get my money back. almost pornographic	0
the material is fine. they cover most of the basics. however, i found the book to be extremely repetitious. they would often say the same thing over and over, page after page. it was comical really. the book could easily have been edited down to half its size.    the construction of the book lacked any organization at all. i got the feeling that the many topics in it were written at different times and slapped together when it was time to put it together for publishing. you could just as easily read it from back to front because there really is no flow to the book.    i also had a problem with this abraham thing. it was kind of a turnoff really. i understand it's a nice marketing angle, but enough already. i hope no one out there really believes that this info came from some supernatural entity. it's too bad, really; the writers seem knowledgable enough to have written on this subject without the need for a gimmick. they know their stuff...but the book could have been much better	2
"even the avid ""trekie"" reader of the star trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds captain kirk saying ""beam me up, scotty.""  but the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that jesus will effectively beam millions of true christians up to heaven in the world-wide ""rapture.""  though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.     the story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.     in the september/october 2006 issue of foreign affairs walt mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.      instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  billy graham's biography by strober notes that they criticized graham's ""new evangelism"" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the ""tribulation force"" or as exemplified by jerry falwell's moral majority.    they are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the united nations. mead notes that it is no coincidence that the left behind novels show the antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the united nations.    the u.s. statistical abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. southern baptists, lutherans, presbyterians, methodists - and catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  such data and the reported popularity of these left behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary american society.    i see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the ""left behind"" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern american society, and as conservative christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  and in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.    thomas j. hickey. christian fundamentalism dramatized"	2
as a long time civil war buff i found this book utterly fascinating. it takes the true story of general sherman and his march to the sea and fictionalizes it just enough to make it   intriguing and even difficult for someone to put down who has little interest in the civil war.    more importantly it explains the reason why he destroyed everything in his path. william tecumseh sherman was hated in the south and even today, to a great extent he still is.  however, his intent was by destroying the food supply, to shorten the war. he did succeed in his goal.    read this book and you will have a true understanding of why the civil war began and lasted as long as it did. fiction, but non fiction	1

i love james patterson and am thrilled that he wrote this book for the younger generation. i bought this book for my [...] year old son and he couldn't put it down. he loved it, and it was all he talked about. now he's reading schools out forever and is glued to that one too! i hope there will more books like these to follow! i am planning to read it myswelf when i finish reading the james patterson book i am currently reading. thank you james patterson!	1
this my first review on amazon but i was compelled to write based on my experience with this course. the first cd is fantastic. it starts off slow and gives you a solid foundation to build upon as you move from lesson to lesson. within a few weeks of driving back and forth to work i had mastered all the lessons on the cd and could easily translate the english phrases in the final review lesson into italian. i was confident and had a good grasp on building sentences and nuances such as how words changed when the subject was masculine or feminine. my opinion is that most people write their review based on the first cd.    and then i put in the second cd. i thought there was some mistake, as if i had switched to a completely different italian course. the slow, clear speaking narrators were gone and replaced with fast talking italians who didn't repeat anything, and certainly didn't give you time to repeat in the pause. the assumption appeared to be that i already understood the language and this was merely a refresher course. within ten minutes i knew this was no longer the course for me. i listened to the entire second cd just in case this was all a joke and at some point they would slow down and actually help me learn italian. no such luck! i have gone back to using the first cd for practice while i wait for the pimsleur italian course to arrive. 1st cd is great - better know italian from 2nd disc on or you'll be lost !!!	2
"this book clearly explains the basic guidelines to becoming a millionaire and taking time to enjoy the little things. michael leboeuf is a great author and knows how to get to the point. the dedication and pride that went into this book is tremendous and it clearly beams whenever you read a passage from any part of the book. always following leboeuf's law: ""invest your time actively and your assets passively."" i advise everyone to do themselves a favor and buy this wonderful masterpiece. it's truly made me a better person. a masterpiece"	1
great fun. dickens' first novel, the first mass-market best seller in world history (coming on the heels of the invention of cheap paper). essential reading for victorian literature and the evolution of dickens' style. this edition (with footnotes and introduction, two appendices and maps) is fine in all respects, except that the print is too small. essential dickens	1
i hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. if thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. i don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be. beautiful beginning / painful (illogical) ending	2
you guessed it.  i'm a cracka from england that has no idea or grasp on african american life; therefore i'm really not qualified to give a justifiable review of this book.  i just figured i would chime in like all racist saltines do.  sorry. ...okay, i'll come clean.	2
"vanishing voices does a good job of showing how larger languages are destroying smaller ones, and the methods of language death.  this is all pretty much common knowledge.  however, the authors fail in their attempt to give a reason as to why language death is something with which we should be concerned.  the only argument they put forth is in a ecological/enviromental analogy, which says that biological diversity is good and stable, therefore, linguistic diversity must.  however, they only go part way in their analogy and reject natural selection for languages.  they also show that linguistic diversity corresponds to environmental diversity, but state this has nothing to do with the inexcessiblity of the areas.  the violin-playing and loaded words are hard to stomach if you are looking for good social science.  i would not suggest the book unless you are an ecological activist wanting to try to link your cause with ""saving cultures"" or with yet another critique of the west. poor analogies, and no real argument"	2
i bought this book in 1981 and lent it to my sister-in-law who promptly lost it.  when my daughter asked me for help to organize her housekeeping,i looked for this book.  i like this book because it is an easy organized system that kept me on track with daily,weekly,monthly,and yearly tasks. sidetracked home executives:from pigpen to paradise	1
alex cross is back, and this time he's after the butcher, the man who killed alex's wife some ten years ago and has been raping and killing ever since. this character, the butcher, is one of the more colorful in cross' bag of collared criminals, and much of the book is spent in the butcher's pov, which adds texture and depth to this novel. alex and his near-constant depression can be boring at times, when he's fretting over nana's workload, how little time he spends with his kids, whether he could have done more to stop the murder of maria, his wife, some ten years ago. but alex gets out of his funk long enough to track down the butcher, and this is a chase i enjoyed. whether or not alex will get bored in private practice and will go back to the fbi is a story line that didn't move me, so i'm hoping he decides to go back, but patterson has another hit with cross, and this series just keeps going. for that, i am thankful. cross-wise	1
"i usually read stephen king for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. i've read three previous king books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  this one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. and this is exactly what ""insomnia"" is. this isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read sep. 10, 1990- nov 10, 1993- three years in which king took to write this book.  three years which were evidently wasted.    the other king books i've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  ""insomnia's"" ralph roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  he is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. his counterpart lois chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with ralph. king doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like ed and helen deepenau, the three bald doctors, and ralph's numerous confidantes.    then there's the whole abortion mess. this central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. though king does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via detective leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.      i gave the book two stars because i am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. the devices were obvious and all thru the reading i asked myself, 'how is king going to get through this?' his weapon of choice was most often ralph robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. it seemed whenever king was in trouble in the story, he would use ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. this is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but king used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.    one last thing, the villians just don't work. they are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? the real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. then there's the crimson king, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  i rest my case. sluggish, uneventful, corny and borrrrring"	2
as a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  if an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! i am tired of the double standard! thank god i didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library. double standard when writing about race	0
big disappointment.  i expected this book to be hysterical.  her sense of humor is certainly different!  very shallow material.  marty wurtz  author of deceptions and betrayal. boring	0
i think this is really an excellent book, one that i would highly recommend.  everyone should read this and realize the words of wisdom by dr. fuhrman.  i have changed my diet radically because of what he has written.  a real wake up call for me!  the diet is easy to follow and one that will revitalize and energize anyone that follows it!  a great read!. excellent book!!	1

"tim lahaye, jerry jenkins, and others in the pre-trib circle, such as ed hindson, tommy ice, chuck missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago.  the notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early church, and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  these men are novices and not prophecy ""experts"" or ""scholars"" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians.  why continue to be deceived?  tim cohen, in his excellent book, ""the antichrist and a cup of tea,"" provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now.  not only that, the same author (tim cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ: ""the real rapture"".  if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear tim cohen's ""the real rapture"" (based on a volume in his forthcoming ""messiah, history, and the tribulation period"" series (see prophecy house's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items). why continue to be deceived..."	0
i read this book in record time.  greg palast took all the pieces of the jigsaw over the last few decades and put them together in a succinctly written way to make me see in a new light this 'government'.  i am ashamed that our own us media is no longer emboldened to fight this hypocrisy we call a government.  from iran to iran contra to iraq and the oil fields, from the halliburtons and all the cronys names who have been hiding for so many years doing so much harm.  thanks for opening my eyes and giveing me a new insite into how easily our democracy can be turned without the participation of all the people.  and how important freedom of the press and the fourth estate is to your democracy. connecting the dots	1
"when i found ""hour game"" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, i thought i had hit pay dirt.  but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as ""the winner"" and ""absolute power"" could turn out such a dog.  long, boring, and confusing.  i fear that mr. baldacci hired an ""aspiring young writer"" to ""help"" him crank out a quick book. i cannot pass this book along to my friends -- i couldn't do that to them.  it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  what a waste.  what a shame. not worth the 25-cent cost"	2
this book is about a writer who splits up with his long-term boyfriend, becomes depressed, and then becomes friends with a young boy (i think 10? 12? i don't remember) over the phone who was abused and used in a kiddy porn ring by his parents before escaping only to learn he had aids and writing a book on it. except as the book goes on, it becomes questionable whether the kid actually exists.    all well and good, but what really makes the book stand out isn't the storyline. noooo. it's the slashy overtones where there really really squickily shouldn't be any! i should not get the idea that this abused kid is this middle-aged author's fantasy. no, no, no.    i felt dirty after reading this. i felt even more dirty after finding out via wikipedia that the author based it on a real life experience of it.    this is a scary scary man, and makes me want a long long bath. i feel dirty now	0

ok, granted, there are a few things in here that deserve a chuckle, but for the most part, this stuff is pure drivel.  definitely not a &quot;sit-down-and-read-it-all-in-one-go&quot; book, but even when broken up into small chunks, you'll spend forever and a day looking for something that's truly funny. this is funny?	2
my family of five (kids presently aged 9,7,3 yrs) has been to walt disney world before.    we love the place and very much look forward to our trips there.    however, experience has taught me that a good guide book is still a valuable tool   when traveling to disney, and well worth the money for the knowledge and tips you gain.    i've bought _the official guide to wdw_ (not worth the $ in my opinion),   passporter's (also good), birnbaum's, etc. but this is still the best--  especially if you are in the planning stages of  your trip.  if you have small kids, i'd recommend getting the smaller, more portable   [... the best general book out there for wdw	1
i've always been a huge fan of nicholas sparks, and i couldn't wait to read dear john. well, there was no reason to rush. it starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. the main girl character is annoying and you hope that john will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book.   i cannot wait for another nicholas sparks book, but only because i want to know that he hasn't lost his touch, and that this novel was just a fluck. a total disappointment and very depressing	2
i'm a huge alton brown fan. this is one of the books i asked for when my birthday came around. i thought i wanted it after reading the reviews and thought it sounded good. i was very disappointed. while there is some good information in it, it's mostly blank pages that you write your own recipes in w/ your notes. there are a few clear plastic pages so that you can put in recipe clippings and instructions and warranties for various kitchen gadgets, but a simple file folder would solve that. sadly, i will be returning this book and finding something else to purchase. not worth the money	0
you won't be disappointed if you purchase this great reference!    not only did the book impress me, but so did the help that i received from laurie ulrich fuller, one of the authors. when i had a couple of questions, i sent her an email. usually one has to wait for quite a while to receive a reply if they even do receive a reply. with laurie i received a reply in less than 24 hours! she was friendly and didn't seem to mind answering my questions. how wonderful it is to find someone willing to help you. no matter how good a book is, it really makes a book outstanding when you can get responses to any questions that that may come up. it keeps one from feeling frustrated.    i rate the book tops. kudos for photoshop cs2 bible	1
"this is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  i read this book and literally did not sleep one night because i was too busy trying to finish the book.  but what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  that's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  this is ""deus ex machina"" in its finest form.  this is unexcusable in my opinion.  i just don't get it.  i just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  i gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  this is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever. this book has a special place in my heart"	2
"possibly the worst book i have ever read.  the ""style"" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  the plot is an imbecilic rehash of the divinci code.  don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  if you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  now open the book at random and read aloud.  this should cause hysterical i-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter. don't!"	0
"although my trips to fast-food joints have only been reduced (not eliminated), i've found myself referring to fast-food beverages as ""drinking corn""....you'll need to read the book to find out why.    i recommend this book if you're at all curious about the food you eat.  it was great that the auther was able to give both sides of the story for each of the 4 meals and i've certainly been taking a closer look at where my food comes from. great insight into what i thought was ""good for me"""	1
"there was such promise, a woman who had ""escaped"" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she ""had"" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  when she ""married"" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the ""affair"" (she got dumped for god.)  she didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  there wasn't any.  sorry.  this novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  ugh!. so sad that women can't seem to ""live"" without men in this novel!!!"	0
this book is about a man named ray atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  someone else knows about the money.  the three major questions for the book to answer are:    1) where did the money come from?  2) who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it?  3) what will ray do with it?    i have reached page 261 in this book, and none of these questions have been answered.  ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all i know is where the money didn't come from.  this is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  the pacing is deadly dull and i keep waiting, waiting, waiting for something to happen and nothing does.  finally i threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when i realized how close to 300 pages i'd gotten with nothing happening.  i don't know why i even gave the book this much of a chance.  nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  if they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  he spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for god's sake!    i may finish it one day, but as of now i just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  not grisham's best, by a long shot. moves far too slowly	2
i agree with one the comments posted below. the main problem with this book is mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. i found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so i could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.    another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.    overall, i thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time. thin characterization	2
there is a profound need for americans to read books about non-western cultures. this is especially true for those in political leadership positions. things fall apart, by chinua achebe, is one such book.    i learned about things fall apart for the first time recently on somebody's blog. i picked it up from the library two days ago and finished it today.    things fall apart is the story of okonkwo, a leader in the village of umuofia in nigeria. the story is told from the point of view that the ibo culture of okonkwo's people. this culture is profoundly different from that of 21st century america. a significant part of this book is spent establishing the culture and society for the reader.    in the first part of the book, the cultural constructs hold the society together, even though things fall apart on occasion on a personal level for okonkwo and others in the book. but things fall apart for the culture as a whole as a result of the arrival of christian missionaries and british colonial rulers. the story of how this happens to okonkwo and his village is told in a simple, accessible, but gripping way.    if you read this book, do not use the speed reading technique of reading the end first. just read it through, and will find that the very last paragraph provides the exclamation point that makes this book's message so important. expand your cultural horizons with this easy to read gem	2
huge disappointment. trace wasn't that good either. having read all scarpetta's previous storiesbut i was hoping trace would be only bad one. however, the downhill trend seems to continue. these two books are not the usual intelligent plots cornwell is capable of writing. save your money, don't buy it. i completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so i won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details. the worst of them all	0
i love doris kearns goodwin's work, and this book is no exception. it's very different from her other books, but very enjoyable.  it brought me back to my childhood while reading about hers.      very short in comparison to her other books, but worth the time and the money.    i have heard complaints that she got some of the baseball facts wrong, but i am not a baseball historian, so this didn't bother me in the least bit. very enjoyable	1
"in order to maintain the legal status of your corporation, you need to pass very specific resolutions and keep very specific records.  i had hoped for a ""cookbook"" for the legal steps required to set up and operate my corporation, but this is not it.      the info on corporate structures is very basic and general - you could easily find this level of detail on the web.  that's my primary complaint with this book...  it mentions what you must do, but doesn't give you the specifics of how.    instead of this book, i recommend you:    (1)  get the *basics* from your lawyer or accountant (or even doing some research on the web)    (2)  buy the corporate minutes book by anothony mancuso instead of this book. just the tip of the iceberg"	2
i have long been hoping to find the one career book that will point me in the write direction of finding the career that i want out of life.  i'm coming to believe that these books are mostly a waste of money.    this book contains a personality test that is not unlike any other career assessment test that you can take online, for free.  it then contains a boat load of charts...50 highest paying jobs for this personality type....50 jobs for this personality type with the highest amount of women/men employed...ect ect.  if this sort of thing interests you then by all means this book might be for you.    most of the book however is a list of different jobs for the different personality types that contains descriptions, experience/education needed, related job, ect but it is all on a very basic level.    save your money and speak with a career counsler. another disappointing job search book	2
"this is easily one of the worst written, worst researched, and worst argued books i have ever read.    in fact it is so bad it is laughable.  i do not agree with their views but this has nothing to do with this review.    turn to the epilogue and read this statement: ""for example, all prophecy scholars agree that the generation that saw israel restored to her land in 1948 could well be the ""generation [that] will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened"" (matthew 24:32-34, niv).""    no one, not even lahaye can actually believe that statement.  you can't get 10 people to agree on what to have for lunch, how in the world will you ever get people to agree on something as controversial as the interpretation of bible prophecy.    other things that had me in stitches was when they said that a past scholar believed there would be 50 years between the rapture and the tribulation.  they then go on to state that they are pretty sure he would change his mind if he were alive today.  that may be true but why even bring it up.  if that makes it in your book you surely must not have much to say.    don't waste your time, money, or effort on this book.  i had never read any left behind or other lahaye prophecy books.  from the outside in it sure seemed like it was a cash cow with little substance.  this absolutely proved to me that my assumption is probably true.    ****a side note****  for those commenting on reviews by partial preterists, you really have no idea what you are talking about.  i understand the futurist view.  i was taught it my whole life and in bible college.  i have read books about it including this piece of drivel.  the least you can do is read something by demar or gentry and learn what you are arguing against instead of making assumptions.  what has been written so far in the reviews really makes you look like you have no idea what you are talking about. terrible"	0

after the letdown of the previous book in this series, it is nice to see stephanie plum back at her real occupation, ace bounty hunter.  well, maybe ace is not the right term, but let it be.    the characters are fine and funny, as in the first ten books.  the gritty streets of new jersey are not exactly scenic but they are very real.  and there is an actual plot, rather than a series of humorous sketches that wear thin when not attached to anything.  as for dialogue, that's why janet evanovich's fans keep coming back for more.  she has a real knack, an excellent ear for the nuances of street dialogue.    i can now rest easy for a while, knowing the writer has not run out of material.  my greatest hope is that she doesn't have a relapse in the 13th episode, that triskadecaphobia doesn't do in our heroine.    p.s.  this is the very best of the twelve books in the plum series, and stephanie holds the record for the most times a central figure is tasered in all of fiction. welcome back, ms. plum	1
i'm so glad that a friend recommended this book to me.  it gave me a better understanding of what's happening to my baby at various stages in his development, which sets my mind at ease.  the book is well-written.  it is divided by ages with a general description of how a baby behaves at that particular age and an explanation of what's happening in the baby's world and how it affects the baby's mood in addition to his behavior. excellent information	1
"in ""iron john,"" robert bly announces that american men are all unhappy because the pressures of civilization have caused them to lose touch with their innate maleness.  he illustrates his point with one of the brothers grimm's more obscure (and frankly less interesting) stories, interpreting it as an allegory that just happens to prove his point.  he also draws heavily on freudian and jungian theories.  he proves his point in the same way freud and jung proved theirs' i.e. by saying ""this is what i see, i am the expert, so that makes it true, occham's razor be darned.""  bly offers no objective evidence to support his positions, nor does he allow room for the possibility of other interpretations or, heaven forbid, that his observations might be wrong.    for example, bly asserts that men become unhappy around the age of 35 (conveniently neglecting to site research supporting this assertion, despite his objective tone).  bly explains that this is because at that age men begin to realize that their childhood dreams will not come true.  he does not consider that by age 35, most men have realized that they don't really want to be firemen.  could this alleged unhappiness possibly be due to media influences that require unhappy customers to sell products to (such as self-help books)?  naw, it's gotta be that ""dreams"" thing.    bly also describes a case where students during the viet nam war broke into their college presidents' office to look for proof that the college was collaborating with the cia.  bly states that this happened because of the mistrust in male authority figures, because their fathers left home to work, preventing their sons from seeing how men work.  bly does not consider the possibility that the students may have been righteously angry about the war and confused by their anger.  no, there had to be a ""real"" reason for the break-in, and aren't we lucky to have robert bly to tell us what it is?    along the way, bly overloads his writing with literary references, all carefully interpreted to suit his purposes.  it's all very pretentious, er uh, interesting, but so what?  i could interpret the same passages to mean something else.  if i lived at the time the passages were written, my interpretation would most likely be very different, despite bly's insistence that his ideas are timeless and universal.    bly' obsession with literary images does more than bog his writing down, however.  it underscores what is wrong with his whole premise.  he tries to build up the notion of the tragedy of lost male identity as objective fact, but uses only subjective views (many not his own and possibly taken wildly out of context) to support the idea.  sorry bob, you can't have it both ways.    one gets the impression that ""iron john"" was cynically written to fill a niche.  like all self-help books, ""iron john"" targets a specific audience, tells them they are not happy, and insists that only by following his directions can they truly be happy.  bly's target audience is white men who went to college and felt left out of the various political movements.  if you do not need a political movement to define who you are, then ""iron john"" is not for you. as insightful as ""real men don't eat quiche,"" but without the humor"	0

"the synopsis on the back cover of saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to perowne's fight to ""preserve the life that is dear to him.""  i wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of ""24,"" but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  as noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  even when there is some tension and action, mcewan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  i just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  in fact, here's my ugly little confession: by the end of this book, i was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  if mcewan decides to write ""sunday,"" we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of chechen terrorists, headed right for chez perowne. nothing happens"	0
"like ""jurassic park"", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters.  my reasons for such an accusation:  1. crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. and while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (dan brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). as a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling.  2. the plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (vengeful gorillas? talking gorillas? misanthropic gorillas? come on.)  3. the book's ending is utterly terrible.  4. cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.    sorry, michael, but this book just didn't do it for me. disappointing"	0

""i"" will be there when it all happens. it's all for ""my"" generation. it's all focused on ""me"".    lahaye and jenkins  clearly capitalise on these feelings, as have generations before them.    nobody ever went broke overestimating the gullibility of the human race. me me me me me"	0
"&#65279;in the end, it appears that by ""anti-catholic prejudice"", jenkins means a failure to regard what he considers to be the core of the roman catholic church with sufficient reverence.   he would probably characterize most of the practicing catholics i know as near-heretical.  jenkins uses related but distinct words like ""bigotry"" and ""prejudice"" interchangeably. it is clear by the end that a great deal of what he is terming ""prejudice"", which is usually applied to hostility from outsiders, is in fact internal dissent and dissatisfaction from current and former catholics.  i refuse to be embarrassed on behalf of my society at large if the hierarchy of any organization is having problems keeping the flock in line.    the book is quite interesting, containing a vast amount of information, including a lot which seems to argue against jenkin's point.  i don't know whether to congratulate him to have the honesty to include it or to suppose that he has completely failed to understand how others might see it.    jenkins is attempting to gain momentum from the various ""liberation"" movements that have arisen in the wake of the civil rights movement that became prominent in the 1950s.   to this end, he employs the tried and true propaganda technique of beginning history at a point where one's own side can be made to look like an injured innocent, i.e., the anti-catholicism of nativists and know-nothings.  if he really wants to trace the history of protestant/catholic conflict, he needs to go back to the reformation at least.  it would also be appropriate to mention the vatican's anti-americanism during the same period; many churches were offended that americans considered the people, rather than god,to be the legitimate source of political power.     in any case, it is irrelevant, since the book largely ignores the unfortunately still extant strains of real anti-catholic prejudice, such as the fundamentalist protestant groups who regard the pope as the anti-christ. jenkins's real foe is people whose argument with the catholic church is not really religious but social.  representatives of the church have often argued that it is their duty to enter into debates of public legislation and morality and i can't disapprove of the participation of any citizen in public debates.   they all enter at the same level, however, and those who participate in the brawl of public debate (excuse me, the marketplace of ideas) must expect sometimes very harsh criticism, although i shall always hope, often in vain, for a level of civility and honest consideration of differing viewpoints.    jenkins feels that the church should be accorded special reverence by all; he seems to suggest that any criticism borders on bigotry.  the church should be permitted to make strongly worded pronouncements without risking strongly worded retorts.   to jenkins, any dispute between the church and any other group, including dissenting catholics, is proof of anti-catholic prejudice.  he would probably deny this and attempts at several points to explain the difference between prejudice/bigotry and acceptable dissent, but the main difference seems to be that acceptable dissent is removed in time and place.  jenkins mentions that the masons were originally welcoming to catholics, but after what he admits to be a campaign of slander and libel by the church hierarchs, became decidely less friendly.  jenkins blames the masons for the ill-will, even though he admits that the church threw the first rhetorical punch.   in many ways, jenkins does as much as any ""no-nothing"" to argue that ""real"" catholics are unable to live in a secular, multireligious society.    it is in his discussion of homosexual issues that this becomes most clear.   i share jenkins' outrage at the invasion of st. patrick's cathedral by act-up, but for the most part he discusses the incident as if the police refused their assistance and society at large applauded; he does eventually admit that even many gay activists were appalled.  i have enough sympathy for the points that jenkins raises about the problems of expecting rapid change with regard to a long-standing and widespread condemnation of homosexually that i would expect to be charged with homophobia.  as an outsider, i would not presume to tell the church how to regard homosexuality or insist that they sanctify gay marriages.   at the same time, if the church is going to condemn gays as hell-bound and attempt to frustrate their efforts to reach an accomodation with the larger society, it is ridiculous for him to take umbrage at non-violent complaints.       jenkins completely misses the point in his discussion on pedophilia.   the issue for most people is less that some priests are pedophiles than the apparent inability of the church to deal with the issue.  people being what they are, this has presumably been an organizational problem for more than 1500 years, yet the church seems baffled.   some people do see this as an opportunity to beat the church and its policy of celibacy over the head, but in fact civil authorities have in the past tried to spare the church embarrassment by declining to prosecute and trusting the church to deal with erring priests.   jenkins ignores this and complains that the organizational strength of the church makes it a tempting target for grandstanding prosecutors, forgetting that this is the very reason that the problems were concealed for so long.  the church is paying more for its own failure to deal with the problem than for the individual transgressions of certain priests. an interesting, but dishonest and discouraging book"	2
"i have read several of nicholas sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  it was a very very slow start.  i was more than 150 pages into it before i got interested in the plot.  i had even considered quitting reading it at times.  it ended up being an okay story, but nothing that i couldn't have lived without reading.  what i did enjoy is the way mr. sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  i would suggest another read from mr. sparks like ""the notebook"" or ""the wedding"" if you want a good romantic read. a bit disappointed"	2

professor briggs provides a fresh analysis of lincoln's speeches -- a subject that is always a joy to study.    abraham lincoln had a life-long compulsion to improve his persuasive abilities.  he was constantly studying, constantly seeking a simple eloquence that could persuade ordinary people to adopt great ideas.  dr. briggs ably unpacks lincoln's speeches, showing lincoln's increasing rhetorical skill.    professor briggs also shows how the substance of lincoln's ideas improved over time, due no doubt to his same addiction to self-improvement.  lincoln wrestled with many great issues of his day, including national expansion, economic development, the railroads and the mexican war.  finally he grappled with slavery, the immense moral dilemma that the founders, the federalists and the whigs had been unable to solve.      the civil war drew upon all the rhetorical skills lincoln had developed.  his oratory infused the north with moral purpose, a determination that ultimately saved the union and freed the slaves.  a lifetime of intellectual, moral and rhetorical improvement broke the back of slavery, giving a priceless gift to the nation he loved.  briggs' study illustrates all this remarkably well. increasing rhetorical power that saved the union and freed the slaves	1

scott poulson-bryant is a bright young artist with heady credentials and a true gift for creative thinking and well-crafted writing skills.  he joins the growing ranks of young african american strong writers such as e.l. ayala, e. lynn harris, keith boykin, j.l. king, caesar brunswick, christopher david, and stanley bennett clay who not only address issues heretofore considered taboo in the black community, but succeed not only as brave new voices but also as gifted, important writers.    hung: a meditation on the measure of black men in america starts out with a terrific cover, promises revelation of secrets everyone wants to know, addresses his reader with pertinent facts, and then progresses to relax and offer a rather personalized memoir of his experiences as a black man in america, a man who knows the myths and the realities about phallic secrets, and shares his own insights as well as those of gentlemanly unnamed confidents from whom he gathers his facts.    along the way poulson-bryant not only discusses phallus size, but he also explores the mystique of black men who model for books (mapplethorpe is a frequent reference point), the porn industry, the world of athletes (yes, naming names), the rap world, and the executive world.  but he doesn't limit his meditation to experiences interviewing men: poulson-bryant wisely includes women in his foray of questioning the importance of size as a feature of desirability vs. myth vs. disadvantage.  it is a well-rounded book and one that never lets the interest lag.    but what one comes away with from this book is an appreciation of the exceptional style of writing of scott poulson-bryant.  he is a writer of charm, of humor, of wit, and of intelligence.  this reader would like to see how he performs in the field of fiction: in reportage he is up there with the best!  grady harp, october 06. an intellectually stimulating treatise on african american men and their auras	2
the concept of this book could've worked, but sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. it's painfully obvious who is driving the car. the dialogue between miles and sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by jonah with open arms. and the ending to the story is laughable. i won't give it away, but i'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. i doubt i can read another sparks novel again. it doesn't get any more predictable than this...	2
"i've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and i thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading ford's pulitzer prize winnning ""independence day"". ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist frank's life. frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. what you think of this book will depend on what you think of frank as a narrator. his desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. i also found him to be longwinded and i had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.    slogged through this book and at the end, i don't think it was worth it for me.     2 star. introspective and longwinded view on suburban male angst..."	2
"""the other boleyn girl"" and ""the queen's fool"" are two of the best books i've ever read--and i've read a lot of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. they were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out, i buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. ""the virgin's lover"" fell flat, and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. anthony trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. that may or may not be the case with gregory. i know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. the more challenging situations are those when i'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. so to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. they feel forced, constructed. i'm going back to trollope. sadly disappointed"	2

"after reading ""the kite runner"" - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship, loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in afghanistan during the russian war and the taliban rule, i set out expecting more of the same from the swallows of kabul.  the latter was quite disapointing.      the swallows of kabul focusses on 4 main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence, cruelty and desolation of their surroundings.  the dismal context of this story is properly set up.  enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the taliban and the desperation of the afghan people is clearly communicated. unfortunately, the novel reads like a short story.  proper character development is not established, so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits.      the novel is successful in  painting a truly depressing picture of afghanistan, making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place.  but if you're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances, then i wouldn't recommend this book for you.  i was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down. a depressing story about miserable people living in a desolate place.

"this is not one of the better entries to this series. after successfully balancing an intriguing mystery with an important wedding in ""rituals of the season"" it is disappointing to have this story be such a mismash. in this book, readers are finally introduced to dwight's ex-wife and his son, cal, but there is no development of either as characters. this is such a strong point to maron's writing--evocative descriptions of people and places--that it disconcerting to put down this book and not feel like i have just been on a trip to north carolina (or virginia.) the characters are flat and unlikeable, the ""mystery(s)"" are odd and the plot just isn't there.   still, any margaret maron/deborah knot mystery is better than none, and the actions in this story will have an impact on deborah and dwight's future, but don't read this expecting a thrilling or clever mystery; read it as a segue to the next book in the series. mediocre maron"	2

"i am reading the fifth edition of this book. in the earlier editions the book was published in three or four volumes. the fifth edition  is a combination of all volumes. so that is good.    the book is a dense read. but the content is excellent. there are 163 chapters in this book. each chapter written by different authors - experts in respective areas. so the book provides a best of breed treatment to various assorted topics. however, not all chapters are good (but most are). i'd say about 20 or so are of filler kind of chapters. nothing really special in them. but the book is worth for the rest of the matter.     the chapters are also written to provoke further thought into each area. kind of ""first principles"" approach - which i like compared to the cissp guide approach of ""here is the information, now devour it for the exam"". however this book is not an exam guide (and i knew that before hand). i bought this book for the matter in it and i am very satisfied.     if you are the kind of person who want to quickly assimilate and regurgitate the matter for cissp, then dont even bother. i am kind of person who loves to read things from the basics slowly, getting the concepts and ideas all clear in my mind and hence i plan to finish this book before reading cissp exam guide (which by the way is also sitting on my bookshelf).    however i have a major complaint againg the publishers. having charged one hundred thirty dollars for a 2000 page book, i'd expect the quality of paper is decent. the paper is so thin, i invariably turn two pages when i am thiking it is one page. it is so thin, even turning the page carefully damages the paper. i agree that the content is specialized and most authors hold at least two or more certifications (cissp, cisa, sscp etc.), but that does not warrant printing the book on really wafer thin transparent paper. sure, the publishers need to make money, but not by compromising the quality of the paper so much.    and you'd expect this kind of book to live on your shelf for a long long time than ""teach yourself crap in 24 hours"" books, but the quality of paper will make that unlikely. hence i am giving 4 stars to a book which otherwise would deserve 6 star. book content is excellent, but paper quality is worst ever"	2
"history has not been kind to this man. perhaps it is because he was interpreted as being a ""penny pincher"" or maybe because he was a friend and admirer of adolf hitler. whatever the reason, even though he was at one time the world's richest man, his triumph seems to have faded into the books. this book is one of them.    if i had to pick a favorite book written by a successful businessman, this has to be it. does it tell you how to become a billionaire? no. what it does teach you is how to succeed, not only financially, but as a person.     it explores the creation of his own wealth, as well as valuable lessons from the construction of his vast oil empire. also, it covers the things that are greater than wealth, such as health, charity, and personality. towards the end, it also becomes a sort of social commentary, on man's degradation of morality and kindess, on the disappearance of art and classical music from the mainstream, and on his general dissatisfaction with similar affairs at that time.    it would be difficult to write a thorough review as to why you need to buy this book, because it is so unlike what you have read before. but take my word for it: you will be a better person for reading this book. it may not make you rich, but it will make you wealthy. wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!"	1
i'm glad to see i'm not the only one to notice the anti-white preaching in this book.   not what i expected at all because this is how history is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   i was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned i already knew.   i graduated from high school in '89 and then got a bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in history.   perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education. too politically correct	2
how is it that the oakland a's have won the al west in 2000, 2002, 2003 (and are all but assured of winning this year, 2006), as well as the wild card in 2001, even though they are in the bottom third of all major league baseball teams in total payroll?  that is the narrative that michael lewis uses to tell the story of his book moneyball.  one of the central tenets of moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued, can, with some specificity, predict certain players' performances in certain areas.  it is, however, only half the story, and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you, old news.  the real story that moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up.  lewis repeatedly describes how the old boys club of major league owners (who lewis affectionately refers to as the women's auxiliary), players, and journalists (former cincinnati red and current espn commentator joe morgan is appropriately skewered) reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like billy beane (the book's main protagonist and current a's gm), bill james, dick cramer, and others.  and on the old boys club the point is lost: that objective statistics have the potential to give small-market teams who cannot afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players, the best chance of winning.  when people point to the fact that the a's have not won the world series since 1989 in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years (roughly since 1999) is when moneyball makes its point. the art of teaching old dogs new tricks	1
"these concerns about this historical account of mao being biased are naive and foolish.  all accounts of past and present events and people are biased because that is the nature of how the controlling / ruling elite record what other members of the elite have done or are currently doing.  very little of the truth can be widely distributed, otherwise the elite would be ousted before dawn.  this reminds me of a quote by bush sr. in 1992 where he says that if americans ever knew what the bush family had done over the years to america that they would be chased down in the streets and lynched.  exactly.      thus, most outlets for information (especially book publishing, and especially books used to teach history) are censored with a fine tooth comb.  in point of fact, historical accounts that are closer to the truth will always come across as bizarre, horrific, and unbelievable to all of us who have been conditioned by our ""education"".  for example, any book on hitler and the nazis that does not delve into the blatant satanism, occultism, ""bull"" homosexuality and fascination with the ancients (ie. egypt, atlantis, and others) is way off course, especially in trying to piece together what happened and why.  of course, this constant throwing us off course is intentional and very well thought out.  also, people like hitler, stalin, mao and others are not ""self-made"", or randomly evil, or ""in the right place at the right time"" like this book claims, rather they are bred, groomed, trained, and then placed into positions of power in order to achieve specific agendas (sometimes unknown to even them).  hard to believe?  there is one place that all of the above mentioned mass murderers can be tied to:  the tavistock institute of london.  research this yourselves.  these monsters are created, and although they may be born of flesh and blood in small towns in china, austria, russia, texas, arkansas, etc., they quickly become nothing like the rest of us and do not consider themselves patriots of any nation.  so, killing us is enjoyable to them, raping and causing us misery is sport to them, and lying about it in the history books is hardly an after-thought.      therefore, does this book go over-board with brutal details?  i would think not at all and i am sure there are many stomach retching accounts of depravity that were not told.  i have read other accounts of breeding children specifically to sacrifice and then eat (yes, i am refering to canibalism).  sometimes, children were / are eaten alive after having been sexually violated and skinned so their terror is at an absolute peak.  this was in mao's regime and many others historically. what is really going on here?! just coincidence?      my major critique of this work is not recognizing mao as a well made product by the hidden hands that control this planet.  he was no random peasant who cut his own swath through the masses and then appeared on the world stage at just the right time.  human history does not unfold that way, regardless of what you may have read. all history is biased"	2
"since i am a patent attorney specializing in computer-related inventions by trade, as well as an avid photographer, i consider myself extremely well-versed in computer technology and digital photography.  i have been using digital cameras and photoshop for years.  suffice it to say that i am not in any way, shape or form a ""beginner.""  i bought this book in order to learn advanced tips, secrets and techniques that would allow me to improve and streamline my workflow while processing my images using photoshop cs.  however, this book is poorly written in the extreme.  it seems that almost every other sentence refers to a step, process, function or photoshop menu item that the author fails to adequately explain, thereby leaving the reader with more questions than answers.  every few weeks or so i keep trying to plow through another section or chapter in the hope that the descriptions and examples will get better.  but it never does.  i have yet to finish a single section of the book and think to myself, ""okay, now i understand this particular concept.""  most often i am left clicking around photoshop menus and searching for options in dialogue boxes trying in vain and with much frustration to find and use some function that the author says should be used but failed to explain or show. most often, the author does not bother to give any examples of what he means when he says you should use some function or process buried behind 2 or 3 levels photoshop menus.  this has turned out to be a complete waste of time and money. obtuse and confusing.  don't buy this book."	0
"from the remarkable book structuring (the ""chapters"" are organized in alphabetical order) to the intriguingly insightful commentary, seth godin has once again created a work of excellence. the book is an easy read, but at the same time leaves the mind reeling with thoughts of ""oh my, i need to fix that, or do that, or change that."" i found the chapter on ""clean fire trucks"" particularly interesting, as i had just 2 months earlier finished an innovation article on ""retiring the fire trucks"" -- which deals with the same concept of preventing fires and not letting them start in the first place! (as such, you can then have time to clean the fire trucks, or as i put it, to retire them altogether!). his rants are compelling yet at the same time hilarious (hilarious in the sense of all the silly things we do as a people that we really shouldn't be doing). take for example his rant on ""wrappers"" and how the method of packaging both the tangible and intangible create an aura around the product that determines how the product is perceived, received, and applied. one might say, ""it's the wrapper, stupid.""    once again, mr. godin has helped to ""validate my existence"" (despite my intense self-certainty!) by showing that the crazy, ""outside the box"" (hey, can we just shred the box, then burn it in effigy of the outdated strategies and the consultants who promote them?), simplifying, forward-looking, remarkable, visionary adventures we can lead our clients and companies on are really worth the effort. in short, less is more, small is big, and remarkable is just that: remarkable.    this book is remarkable. i strongly encourage adding it to your shelf, then spreading the virus of its contents to others.    p.s. the entire ending ""bonus section"" on blogs and other resources is something not to be missed, and single-handedly justifies the purchase. mr. godin rides again! a triumph for those marching to a different drummer!"	1
alicia drake writes well, that's a given - she's a journalist. she makes all the excess of paris during the 1970's and early 80's come very much to life. cocaine, heroin, disco, silk and lace. but the main argument of her book, that karl lagerfeld and yves saint laurent are both sociopaths is not that earth shattering. after all, who is she intending to enlighten by this book: middle america? - they could care less - the fashionistas? - they already know all this stuff.   drake doesn't seem to understand that when writing a biography the last thing you want to do is create it in a vacuum. in the end, i didn't know anything more about lagerfeld and ysl than i did when i began this turgid ice-capade. the two enigmas remain enigmatic. her threads are stretched beyond their breaking points through their endless repetition and as with all fashion journalism, there's a heavy air of self-hatred and revenge hanging over the whole endeavor. ooh-la not 	2

a writer who undertakes to translate a complicated and nuanced work by an acknowledged literary master puts himself into an unenviable position, especially should the work have already been previously translated by another and be considered definitive.  and yet heim's update on the classic lowe-porter translation has made mann's aschenbach more fully human, more tragic and less comic, still every bit as pompous and self-justifying, more insidiously real.  it's a triumph of the translator's art.    to me, anyhow, mann's book has always been at least as much about the language, the inner self-talk of aschenbach, as it has been about the story line or plot.  it is fascinating to see how the author enters the mind of a man who has spent his life in rigid self-denial, self-deception really, and slowly - and not without considerable struggle from his ego against it - expands his consciousness.  by book's end aschenbach has not only found himself, he can no longer deny himself, he accepts himself as he is and then of course he dies.  the journey he undertakes - not just from serious and constricted germany to a holiday resort on the lido in venice, but from stuffy and self-important man living a lie, a life of 'despites', to allowing himself to be fully conscious of one true emotion and impulse and allowing it, even willing it to take him entirely over, to free him from himself, is the thing.    well, it's a spellbinding book, and one which rewards close rereading. transcendant translation	1

for an avid reader like myself, it's often tough to know what to read next. in this book, nancy pearl helped me get quite a few suggestions.    the book is helpfully broken up into little chapters about different genres or subjects, such as action heroines. i found it great, because if i'm not interested in that particular subject, i can just skip to the next section.    the only thing that prevented me from giving this book 5 stars was that the summaries about the books are way too short. i really couldn't tell whether i'd like the book or not until i had come and read a few of the book's reviews on amazon.    all in all, this is a marvelous book, chock full of great suggestions for the casual and avid reader. i recommend it wholeheartedly. great book about great books	2
absolutely hilarious.  i wish i could get amnesia just so i could read it again and be surprised. so freakin' funny...	1
j.k. rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  the characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  i'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and i've read this far so i might as well go the whole way.     in books one through four the trio of harry, ron, and hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.    this book harry seemed to care more about romance.  a very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  a female character from the background, whom harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.    harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  the clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  the image of harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with malfoy.    as to the general plot of the book.  poorly done.  continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.    my final opinion: don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  a very disappointing book. too popular to bother trying anymore.	0

i hate to rain on everybody's parade, but i found this book to be a rehash of stuff i've read over and over in other places. there's too many numbers in here. what people need is an attitude about money, not just &quot;save  so much money for so long at 10% interest per year and you'll have so much  saved for retirement at 65, but if you wait until you're 35 to start,  you'll only have this much saved....&quot; (that's not a quote from the  book, but you can place that quote in almost any financial book, and it  will fit just fine). personally, i thought the millionaire next door was  better and rich dad poor dad in a leauge of its own. any book on this  subject will certainly convey &quot;some&quot; information. the problem is  that they are too number oriented. people need to focus on paying  themselves first regularly, having a set savings program and intelligent  investments. this book seems to be more focused on getting rich by  retirement. that's just great, but anybody who saves money over 40+ years  darn well better be rich by retirement or they don't know what they are  doing. on the other hand, i think the authors are realistic in the sense  that this is not get rich quick by any means. if you want to sum it all up,  no matter who you are or what your circumstances are, save money on a  regular and consistent basis, cut up all of your credit cards, pay cash for  everything, keep your wants and spending under control and that's about it  really. it's not that hard to get rich. i just wish the book had more  practical information and less technical analysis with all those numbers  and statistics. same old stuff	0
"normally, i find it hard to put a sue grafton book down once i get started. not the case with ""s"". i did not enjoy the plot about violet and her abusive husand.  the main character violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  i didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. the ending wasn't clear either. i did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.    i missed her interactions with rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker henry. usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.   i would vote pass on this one. s is for slow read"	2
"i've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and i thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading ford's pulitzer prize winnning ""independence day"". ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist frank's life. frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. what you think of this book will depend on what you think of frank as a narrator. his desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. i also found him to be longwinded and i had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.    slogged through this book and at the end, i don't think it was worth it for me.     2 star. introspective and longwinded view on suburban male angst..."	2
"as someone who was certainly an undergraduate when sacks was teaching and who has taught both high school and college, i have to say that i found the book to be quite laughable.  the entire book seems to come down to, ""these damn kids today!  boy, when i was a kid..."" and resembles little more than one of grandpa simpson's long meandering stories.  (*gasp!* a reference to popular culture, oh no!)  sacks never had any teaching experience nor training and was somehow suprized to learn that he was horrible at teaching.  what?   you mean to do something well you might need to learn about it and have some experience doing it???  this is, of course, ironic because sacks was teaching classes on journalism and constantly critiques his students who ignore his journalistic experience and yet throughout the book he ignores and mocks the advice of teachers who have teaching experience.    dear kettle,   you are black.    sincerely, the pot.  throughout the book he makes constant references to kids who wear baseball hats in class, sloutch, and have piercings as if someone's appearance is indicative of their worth or ability.  i'm sure he would have a heart attack if he walked into my classroom and saw me teaching with a baseball hat on.  all of his critiques would be fine if only he had done one thing: research.  he constantly compares his experiences as a teacher in the 90s with his own experiences as a student decades before.  however, all he offers is anecdotal evidence based on his own memories when comparing students then and in the 90s.  if he had taken a minute to get down off of his high horse he might have went and talked to some teachers who had been around for decades and asked them their thoughts on students, or even better, go hunt down his college professors and ask them about classes in which he was a student.  however, rather than go out and do some good investigative reporting and gather all the facts, he chose to write a poorly informed book-length letter to the editor about those damn kids who keep walking on his lawn.    this book is a missed opportunity to have a real look at students in colleges.  it is a shame that someone with no teaching experience and such an inflated self of self-importance (the very things he chastises his students for) chose to think that he was qualified to write it. these damn kids these days!"	0
"if this book applies to the rest of the world, and all of history, then most of the evil done is not by evil men, but by highly intelligent, highly educated men who wish to possess great political power so they can do good. but, as the old saying informs us, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. these men had good intentions, but little understanding of how to use it. or of human nature, for that matter. graduates of the most prestigous universities, rich, insulated from the rest of the country, they saw the populace merely as pawns to be used for their ends. halberstam uses the word ""hubris"" many times, and i think his analysis is correct: the men involved (and in some cases, women) were far too interested in political power. the book is a warning to those who believe in the power of big government to effect beneficial changes; that power, unfornately, does not exist. as always, when human fantasies run up against reality, reality always wins out. unfortunately, the people are the ones who suffer, not the politicians and other movers and shakers in government. high iq idiots"	1
"i usually don't review books i didn't finish reading or movies i didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though i listened to it as an audiobook so i could do other things while ""reading"". i turned it off after six chapters and i'm not likely to finish it. this is my first nora roberts book and if they're all like this i really don't have any clue why she's so popular. i'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.     stay away from this one. boring, boring, boring.

i picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book.  the book was anything but funny.  i read about half, up to  the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore.  i consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me.  the graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. i am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but i  had to throw it away because i did not want my children to get a hold of it.  i found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. i started hating them for the abuse they put their children through. this is sick	0
i was tremendously disappointed in this book.  the cost of $35-50 is definitely a complete rip-off for what you get from the author.  all you need to do is refer to pages 227-246.  those are the pages that represent the bibliography.  i actually was so pissed off after reading this book that i counted them.  in total the author referenced the words and work of 488 author people.  there are only 223 pages of text and 6 chapters in the book.  i am certain you can do the math but i'll do it for you.    there are on average more than 2 references per page and over 80 per chapter.  it's as though the author has never had an original thought of his own.  if i wanted to hire somebody to go out and look up the work of other people i would have done that.  i was expecting the author to use his own first-hand knowledge and experience in order to help educate and inform others such as myself about the process.  instead, what i got was something a high school student would do while trying to complete a report for homework.  my only question is who is less ethical:  the author or the publishing company that let this slide through the screening process.  for all of those that gave this book 5 stars i can only guess that you don't enjoy actually reading. don't waste your money	0

"as a matter of fact, i must say my first real love was star wars chronicles, first edition from 1995, not only because of my likeness for the old trilogy, but because of the data and images about characters, weapons, landscapes, behind-the-scenes images you can find in the great book.  now i must say, i was interested in this new book just because i read the names and credentials of the authors although my interest in this new george lucas creation is not my favorite trilogy and i could say something about it. then i thought, ""well, maybe today's young kids will love this second trilogy more than the first one, and their hearts will bit for darth maul even more than for darth vader"". if someone had to write this book, there's no other choice than these huge star wars knowledgemen, these fanfiles yodas.    now, star wars chronicles the prequels is a ""had to be written"" book and it's absolutelly amazing with its more than 3000 images about the prequels, all those characters, all those ships, all those light sabers... all those worlds.    now, star wars chronicles, tp has won a proudly place beside my old and dusty star wars chronicles. don't you doubt it: this book is your next ""need to have"".    and why don't i give it a 5 star rate? i think chronicle books should think a bit on spanish translation for this wideworld phenomena book. i'm absolutely sure they will reach a really important market here.    darth khan. great and amazing item"	2
"i absolutely love paula and this is the first cookbook of hers that i've bought. the book has a great layout (cakes, pies, cookies, bars, etc.) there are a few pictures (they are not on the same pages as their recipes) that make me want to bake even more! everything in the book sounds so delicious but the thing that really got me was her pound cake. now she has about 5 or 6 pound cake variations - i tried the cream cheese variation. over the past 6 months i have been searching for ""the"" pound cake recipe and have tried a ton of different ones always with disappointment. when i tried paula's i kept my expectations low and i was blown away!! it actually tasted like pound cake, not too sweet, not to floury--just perfect!!! i can't wait to try the rest of her recipes, for each ten i looked at i would deffinitely try at least 8 and consider the other 2! a minor disappointment is that some of her recipes call for pre-made cake mixes. although it is great for cutting down on time i suppose, i don't see the sense in putting pre-made mixes into a cookbook. still doesn't take away from the flavor or temptation of her desserts. excellence. scrumptous"	1

"i have long had the desire to read a grisham book, because i have heard good things.  well, my chance came and i was sorely disappointed.  the audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and i decided to get them for the chamber.  the opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, i had already decided this, ""if sam cayhall lives i'm going to be mad because i get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the ""hero"" to the story.""  sadly, i pursued curious about the ending.  i'm very glad i got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  sure wish i had those six hours back and the money invested so i could try a diferent author.  mayber grisham's other books are better, but i won't be reading them. wish i hadn't wasted my time, but saved by listening to story"	0
this was the first nora roberts book that i had read and it is now, i think, my most favorite book i have ever read.  i have never been interested in reading a romance before, but this struck me as being different and it was!  it has romance in it difinately...very good romance i might add...but it is a thriller!  i couldn't put it down and i'm not kidding!  i read this book in a week and it normally takes me close to a month because i just don't have that much time to read.  i found my self making time to read this book! it is very graphic with the murders, rapes and animal killings, but reading that kind of stuff doesn't really bother me.  it's seeing it in a movie that i can't handle.  but i think nora roberts knew what she was doing by making it so graphic.  you just want to kill this guy, and you find yourself prying your eyes open even when your exhausted and want to go to bed just to see if maybe on the next page you figure out who this guy is.  not only is the suspense awsome, but her characters are great. you just really get involved with them and really feel what they feel. i loved reading about the girls learning to run a ranch, ride horses, and heard cattle and stuff like that.  everything about the book is just awsome!. awsome!!!!!	1
timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. it's an indulgent bit of junk food.  timeline starts with a hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of new mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters.  there are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. the story is ever-predictable and ludicrous.  but, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry.  go back and read andromeda strain. readalbe but junky	2
i picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book.  the book was anything but funny.  i read about half, up to  the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore.  i consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me.  the graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. i am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but i  had to throw it away because i did not want my children to get a hold of it.  i found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. i started hating them for the abuse they put their children through. this is sick	0
this is probably one of my favorites.  she has characters you care about from the beginning and the deceased father's entangling demands to inherit his property and money are an added way of punishing his children for his indifference to them thoughout their lives. enthralled	1
i found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena.  i have no argument with the fact that it happens, or that many people have this take on the issue.  however, the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with heresay, exageration, and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with psequipedalianism. agitating	0
"this is as exciting and convoluted as any of the master's thrillers; prior reviewers have detailed the story sufficiently. i'll only add that the plot's twists, turns and surprises continue right on up to the final paragraph in the epilogue.    although i enjoyed the story immensely, i had the sense that the action scenes lacked the ""ludlum strategy"" of realism and credibility [after all, how can many times can one super-agent overwhelm four or more opponents singlehandedly; or one untrained woman knock out two professional killers?].    on checking the book's front pages, i learn that the 'ludlum estate' (the author died 12-mar-01 in naples, fl) commissioned a ""qualified author and editor""; the unanswered question remains whether this book -- prominently displaying ludlum's name -- is an updated previously unpublished manuscript, a thriller developed from a premortem story outline, or whether the commissioned author wrote this book singlehandedly.    if this is indeed an original de-novo piece of writing, then the true author deserves not only a great deal of credit, but ought to publish under his/her own name rather than remain anonymous; s(he) would make a genuine contribution as an independent, skilled and accomplished writer of thrillers. i have the uncomfortable gut sense that this ship may be flying under a false flag ... unless and until the authorship provenance is more fully clarified. captivating global spy thriller - but ludlum died in 2001; who's actual author?"	2
excellent compilation on leadership attributes for innovation and is a collection of well written articles which made me think and connect to a real world phenomenon. i enjoy reading peter drucker's books and the content of the book has peter drucker's flavor to it. the clarity and style of this book is truly outstanding. excellent compilation on leadershipattributes for innovation	1
a friend recommended tony hillerman as she knew i read many mystery books. i became addicted to his writing after the first book.  i now have copies of all his books plus a map of the territory in which the stories take place. if you like mysteries with a slight twist and a reasonable ending, you will enjoy any of the hillerman books. any  tony  hillerman  book	1
this author claims that the baudelaire children cannot see through count olaf's disguises, which is patently absurd, as any reader of the snicket series would know.    she has squandered all her credibility by making this absurd claim, and i would not recommend this book to my dog as a chew toy, let alone to anyone to read.     either she didn't read the books, didn't really absorb what she read, or most likely, merely skimmed the books and paid little attention to them in her haste to capitalize on snicket's good name.    don't read this book, don't get it from a library, it is a big waste of time. avoid this book at all costs	0
the author encourages us to recognize that making mistakes is part of creating.  experimenting, finding what works and what doesn't work, and going on is the process of creativity.  this book is useful for the beginning and the experienced artist. failing and then succeeding in creative efforts	1

"while there are those who would give this 5 stars even if it featured nothing but dancing elephants, those with any amount of knowledge of the present state of scholarship will find these essays somewhere in the range of speculative-outdated-appalling. cavin -- the man who invented the ""jesus had an evil twin who faked the resurrection"" theory -- makes for an intro that may as well have come from acharya s. martin and drange need an education in how an honor and shame society worked. derrett? i wonder how he gets away with an argument that amounts to racial stereotyping (""jews are good with money"") in this day and age. carrier does the watusi to get out of the consensus on the meaning and understanding of resurrection.    you know me, then you know where to go. out of date before it was printed"	2
"...but not all that affective. which is not a bad thing at all. unless there are noble attempts at such a thing, which, i suppose, is really up to debate with this work. but what expectations can one have with a work like this? what the reader has here is not really a ""novel"" but something greater, something post-, something meta- (although in a bearable way, at least barnes has taste). it is, however, quite educational, very witty, very stylish (in a good way, see ""barnes has taste"" in the previous sentence for more on this) but also often quite maladroit, even if in a skillfull way. sometimes, especially in the times when the focus is shifted to the narrator, it feels like the story is being poked into an uncomfortable position, before it returns to its natural form in the next chapter (like the metal in braces!). but, it is, at the very least, a rewarding book and at the best quite brilliant. very muchso indeed. quite effective"	2
my introduction to borges was through the collection labyrinths. i immediately fell in love with the stories, the prose, the poetry, and so went on to buy this complete volume. while it is nice to have all borges's stories in one place, and at a reasonable price, the language doesn't really hold up for me. the translation is... well, not sloppy, but too simple, like those childrens' versions of classic novels they pressed on you in 5th grade. i have nothing against andrew hurley, but his translation of borges leaves me cold. i'd give borges 5 stars out of 5, but hurley? no more than 2. the translation is a problem - the stories are not	2
"intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new ""web 2.0"" universe, i was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis.  from the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument.  the book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance.  i would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir. little more than a collection of anecdotes"	2
not only is this a very thorough book, but it is available from  amazon's 'new & used'  sources  for  quite a low price, considering how recently it was published. i recieved a hard cover edition for 5.94!  i only have one complaint: most of ilg's promotional photos on-line show him using an elaborate system of yoga blocks, presumably to enhance the forms' effectiveness. i was quite interested in this aspect of his training, and  was, ( i feel, rightfully), assuming that the book would elaborate in this direction. unfortunately, there is no mention whatsoever of the blocks and their uses here in the book.  why. a good book, with one reservation.	2
it's the polar opposite of good writing.  it's so familiar, so conversational, so unturgid, and so padded with fluffy stuff it's unreadable.  even worse than i figured it would be.  oh, well, now i know after wondering all these years. undesirable	0
"i think i've read most of mr. woods' stone barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - but this is a sad addition to the collection. he just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......i think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': ""you just have to release another stone novel this year!"" there's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... how sad............"	0
"the play ""into the woods"" not only contains sinister elements, but has an overall dark message to convey.  it preaches moral relativism as blatantly as any catechism teaches religious doctrine.  it teaches is that lying, stealing, cheating, and even murder can be justified as long as it is not against one's perspective on life.  also, that life is grim and experiencing things forbidden will help you.  this religious doctrine of corruption is conveyed through the story and through specific lyrics of the songs. not what it appears to be"	0
like many of the other reviewers, i found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  however, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.    what's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.      interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  a good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great. mediocre... good for healthy advice, bad for recipes.	2
i have been trying to read this book for over a year.  i can't get into it and i think it's time to throw in the towel.  i have gotten half-way through but the author jumps around too much.  the stories are interesting but don't really seem to have anything to do with one another.  too many characters - could use a cast of characters or map showing how characters are related at the beginning.  the upside is that the individual stories are well written and it addresses some interesting topics. way too boring and confusing - couldn't finish it	2
"this book is not for everyone. if you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that (such as long-winded language that seems outdated to us today), then you should stay away.    for lovers of classical and relatively easy to read literature, this is a good book. a lot of things are amazing, considering how long ago they were written and what overall level of scientific knowledge was at the time. some of it just boggles my mind.     at the same time, the book is long winded and in the end, not quite as much happens as one would expect. dan brown's davinci code has more things happening in the first 20 pages than verne has in his entire book. but that is ok in a way, because when i read a classic, i do not expect to compare it to modern standards. the entertainment is due to different factors. in fact, the way the book is written is part of the entertainment and not just the story.    i do not give this book 5 stars however, because i was disappointed in the end, since not enough of the story really comes to a conclusion. i do not want to spoil the book for you, but there are a lot of unanswered questions, and getting those answers really was what kept me reading. there is quite a bit of build-up, and then in some ways, the book just ends. (i noticed that style in many books of that time, where the narrator just says ""here is what i know... but i do not know the whole story..."").    also, to some extent, i agree with some of my fellow reviewers that gave a lower score, in that it is too much of a narration rather than a real story. i do not complain about some of it being like a log book, but i would have wished to get a bit more information about the daily life on board. i just do not buy that the 3 travelers just stayed in their room. they must have found out a bit more about other parts of the boat. or at least attempted it, and that would have been interesting to read about, without breaking with the overall style of the book. good, in a classic sort of way"	2
"this is truly a disappointing book.  it starts incredibly slowly and i found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  another disappointment is koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in ""the hideaway"" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out rvs, and (4) evil bioethicists.    the leilani character is patently ridiculous.  she conveniently has a genius iq, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  i found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/mr or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  dean heaps the hardships on poor leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of walker, texas ranger.  in case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.    i don't know how or where dean koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, i can assure you that this is patently untrue.  that koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.    the final issue is koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly golden retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  it is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  his obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and i like dogs).  this novel probably features the most egregious example of koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.    dean koontz has written many books better than this one.  spend your money on one of his stronger efforts. one of koontz's worst"	0
"i have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio cds from the library. i was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. he sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in ""w"" - it drives me mad. he reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.     i am a big fan of audio cds because i can listen to the stories while doing other things - i'm not tied down to the couch. i have listened to many narrators - jim dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. charles frazier may be a ""brilliant"" author, and should stick with writing - period! leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life. boring narrator"	2

"i almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. i was determined to try though. once i got used to the almost non-existent editing i was able to enjoy the story. it is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. i'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! it added nothing to the book to create a new ""style"" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. this is one of the few times that i wish i had just watched the movie instead. interesting story, difficult to read, see the movie?"	2

for most people, this kind of lifestyle is only a dream, but wow, what colourful and beautiful dreams.  this book is choc full of stunning photos that reflect the wealth some people luckily or unluckily have.  their houses (or should i say shrines) are treasures in their own rights, but the possesions inside are also gems.  the tiffany theme is reflected in here all the way through and there is some stunning pieces.  this is a pricey 'coffee table' book, but it's so beautiful, you'll be glad you treated yourself or someone else. you could only dream :-()	1
this book really helped coalesce in my mind that sometimes it's not the party, it's the man.  by serving presidents from both parties, gergen forces republican and democratic readers to set aside their party loyalty to confront the reality that both parties have had recent presidential successes and failures.    for example, i was a proud reagan youth who didn't vote for clinton in 1992 however, by 1996 i had to admit that clinton was doing an excellent job of leading the country in spite of my party's obstructionist activities that only hurt the country.  gergen explains how clinton was able to overcome and succeed in spite of opponents intent on political destruction rather than serving their country.    gergen also provides excellent examples of what many of us realized by 1984 about reagan, that while his rhetoric mainly appealed to the conservative right, reagan was truly a president to all americans and governed from the middle.    if are you interested in presidential politics and care more about the country than you do about your party, this is a great case study.  if you are a senior manager responsible for large numbers of people, this book is also an excellent manual on managerial success using your own style and approach.  if you are looking for ammunition to do battle against ideological opponents, this is not the book for you. a rare perspective that demands a hearing	1
"scientific? i couldn't get more disgusted.    this review is written because it can accomplish much, that is, let no one science-interrested person fall in this trap.    i did never read more than 20% of the book, that is a short one, i can only guess that its because there would been to much nonsens even for the most naive readers. i read until i had heard to much about the ""revoloutionating discovery"" (that you have not heard of in serious papers as nature or new scientist, why?)    this revaloutionary discovery etc. was a machine build by someone, that claims it could measure feelings, so for example it could measure in a black room when there was a big group of people feeling the same thing, maybe an os contestant from usa (where the machine would be) winning the championship in whatever.    well, then it was tested in superbowl but failed, the author explains this due to commecials distorting the feelings the public felt etc...    how would this machine be able to notice somethings like this? well they must have checked out a list of ""strange"" topics from physics and chosen zero point energy that has to do with the vacuum. they could not choose something like electromagnetism, because that might be disregared right away by the public who might know to much about it.    claims that the machine is working is based on odds for it not to be this way were apperently about 1:1000 (i don't doubt that more than 1000 of these experiments have been made and failed)  the author also claims that there was a scientific explaination with the feeling an moon astronaut felt when he was away from earth, he felt connected to earth in some kind of way.    i laugh in disgust, noticing this book is nothing, absolutely nothing, compared to others that actually stand out as great books, giving you an ""wooow!"" but with a scientificually accepted material as background. examples of these are:    qed: the strange theory of light and matter by richard feynman, who was one of three to individually invent quantum electro dynamics, that is the most fundamental description of electromagnetism. this book is based on a series of lectures feynman made in university of auckland, new zeeland, to a public audience.    deep down things: the breathtaking beauty of particle physics by bruce a. schumm.  a book staying focused on the subject that lies around particle physics, a wooow! i got from this book was the connections between the mathematical lee groups and the quantum forces of nature (electromagnetism, the weak force, the strong force), discribed greatly on a non professional level. science? i couldn't get more disgusted."	0
the original worst case scenario handbook was a good guide, essential for your paranoid friends. i enjoyed that one, so for some reason my family has given me all the follow-on books as gifts. none of them really compare to the original, but this one comes close in some respects.    many of the scenarios are completely outlandish, so don't buy this looking for practical advice.  unlike the original, this isn't a book to buy your paranoid death-fearing friend.  some advice is practical, like dealing with swallowed mistletoe, driving in a blizzard, or dealing with a canceled plane flight, but it can get lost in the more outlandish, like fending off unwanted kisses, jumping from a runaway sleigh, fending off a charging reindeer, dealing with a meddling parent, etc.  some situations just don't boil down to 3 easy to follow steps and a diagram.    i do love the section on repurposing a fruitcake, though.    enjoy this for a small laugh and pass it around amoung the adults for the holiday. it's a gag gift, not as practical as the original	2

read this book! the story of a half-chinese, half jewish halfwise autograph man, a drunkard and drug addict who doesn't get along with life, love and religion, sadly isn't even half-interesting or - behave - intelligent. in fact it is really annoying: the initial situation offers some some basic aproaches but zadie smith doesn't manage to develope them thrillingly. anytime i felt just a little bit of excitement and turned the page to read on, it just started to get really boring again. you really wanna get bored...?	0
i have only read 60 or so pages so far, but as other readers have accounted, i have a difficult time putting the book down.  it reads like a hollywood movie, i have to snap myself to attention every-so-often to remind myslef that these accounts are true to life, that these things actually happened, which makes it even more gripping. the way the author goes from the experiences of the ghost soldiers and the prisoners on the death march is perfectly mixed.     nicely done. great so far	1

"according to the authors, ""this book tells the inside story of justhow disney's success was achieved -- not by epiphanic flashes ofcreative insight that produced a pinocchio or a dumbo, but by the forceof a much-considered, carefully wrought process of managing innovationand creativity and by an adherence to a firmly system of beliefs.""the material is organized within 11 chapters, followed by an epiloguein which the authors observe that the integration and interplaybetween and among the ten principles they have examined can be ofsubstantial benefit to other companies. the ""dream, believe, dare,and do process"" does indeed have all manner of potentialapplications for companies in industries wholly unrelated toentertainment. there must be dreams to believe in and courage topursue those dreams. those who share my high regard for this book areurged to check out warren bennis' organizing genius, one of whosechapters focuses on the disney team which produced snow white and theseven dwarfs. the roi of magic"	1
"i've read almost all of danielle steel's books and i don't think i've ever bought one brand new.  i usually get them at half price books for $2-$4.  this one caught my eye at the store when it first came out and after reading the summary in the back cover, i bought it.    its a quick read, i got through it in only a few days.  its a more diverse storyline than she's presented in the past, but the ending just wasn't believable.  most of steel's books end with a ""happy ending"" and although most of us want that, sometimes it just doesn't make sense.  the ""meat and potatoes"" of this book revolves around the tragedy that befalls a once-wealthy family.  the introduction of the 'bad guys', the buildup of the plot, the execution and then finally the resolution.  it seems that with 100 pages to go, steel wants to toss in a romance.  doesn't work!    she doesn't build the romance at all, not in a believable way anyway.  it seems one minute she's talking about a cop who's been with his wife for 17 years and ""he'll never leave her"" and the next thing you know...a week later he's in love with someone else!      didn't like the ending, doesn't make sense.  this book could have taken about another 100 pages to draw that out, and that's something we didn't need.  wait for it in the bargain bin. a quick read, but not her best"	2

i didn't think that manning books could get lower than wrox, but i was very wrong.  unless you are doing very, very simple hibernate 2 or want to how to use xdoclet and ant, this book is a waste of money. if i were the authors, i would return the money to the publisher. you can forget in depth examples.  this book has the most trivial of examples, but it does have pages and pages of exposition on why hibernate is so cool.  the real meat could be put into a 12 page booklet.    with a publish date of 2006, this book needs to be more up to date. to make matters worse, some diagrams are incorrect, many pages are smudged and smeared and the book reads as an insult.    i remember the days when computer books were actually helpful and useful, this book brings modern tomes to yet another new low. i thought the on-line docs for hibernate were bad, but this book is worse.  wow.  worse than wrox and worse than the on-line docs.  makes me want to read an old vax manual just for the fun of it.    this is the first and very last manning book i will ever buy. the few i have read before i was able to get the gist by spending 20 minutes in the bookstore reading.  peak and heudecker should stick to creative writing as that is what thy do best in this book. manning sinks to new low	0

"i read this book in 2002 way before the iraq invasion seemed probable.  after reading it (and believing that i was reading thorough reporting) i supported going after the wmd in iraq.  however, now that we've seen how judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no wmd found in iraq i strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.    some of the non-iraq wmd reporting was very interesting and i learned a bit from that, but how do i separate fact from fiction?  as a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and judy's recent comments, ""the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong,"" which is not true (read john macarthur, ian williams and joby warrick), i think this book loses its credibility.  you may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction. great read but where are the wmd she claims in the book?"	2

"noll identifies twelve ""turning points"" in the history of christianity, times at which the faith struck off in a distinctly different direction from that which it had been traveling.  he seeks to set forth the significance of each turning point and set it in its proper place in the broad sweep of history.    you cannot argue with his first few choices, although he seems to read more consequence into the events than may be warranted.  the fall of jerusalem was indeed a watershed event, but noll sees its significance in the formation of canon, clergy, and creed.  these three things formed after the fall, and would have formed quite differently but for the fall, but were not the direct result of the fall.  the main significance of the fall is that it freed christianity from its status as a sect of judaism.  until jerusalem fell, the premier church of christianity was the jerusalem church.  the jerusalem church considered itself a sect of judaism.  until the death of the jerusalem church, all christians everywhere would feel constrained to follow its lead.    one must wonder whether it was the council of nicaea or the battle of the milvian bridge that was the second turning point in christian history.  nevertheless, the nicene creed's significance cannot be overstated.    the next turning point, the council of chalcedon, ""settled"" christ's nature.  although there is still disagreement among  various christian denominations, most still adhere to the doctrine of christ hammered out at chalcedon.    later ""turning points"" are more debatable.  charlemagne's coronation may or may not have laid the foundation for christendom.  you could make an excellent case for the proposition that we have constantine, not charlemagne, to thank for christendom.    some ""turning points"" aren't so much turning points as symptoms of greater movements within christian history.  the english act of supremacy, which was basically an act of convenience for an heirless king, was more symptom than turning point, as were the french revolution and the ministry of wesley.  noll makes this amply clear in the chapters devoted to those ""turning points.""    his most intriguing chapter is the last, as he maps out the survival of christianity under communist repression and the explosion of christianity in africa and south america.  this last phenomenon goes far to set at naught the arguments of those who see christianity as irrelevant in the postmodern world. tedious, meandering, but worth the effort"	2
"of all the books which dominated the discussion of analytic philosophy in the 90s, john mcdowell's *mind and world* was actually the one which most nearly brought home the prize of great philosophy without naughty bits: and this most nearly in the form of an inversion of lukacs, ""reification and the consciousness of the professoriat"".  his early oxgaffes having been forgotten, mcdowell was here free to offer an ""unpolitical"" account of contemporary thought drawing heavily from classic works.  but if the result is not quite robert brandom's linguistic leninism, the reader ends up getting a story about ""who's to be master"" that has a little too much excitement squeezed into mcdowell's oscillating queries.    much as brandom makes a hash of the relationship between formal semantics and ""inferentialism"", mcdowell's account of hegel's relationship to *bildung* does not even crib gadamer's ""historically effective consciousness"" as a corrective to his ""uncritical"" eudaemonism (those interested in hegel's intellectual relationship to aristotle would do well to look at alfredo ferrarin's book instead) -- and the excitement one is  forever waiting on with respect to sellars is pressed into service for a thoroughly unserviceable treatment of hegel's remark ""in thinking, i am free, because i am not in an other"" -- very much the product of stoic philosophy, and very much militating against the ""therapeutic"" story about non-conceptual content directly following (with apologies rendered to peacocke for his rather more serviceable story).     is any of this that objectionable?  no, and although mcdowell's work was very much ""in a vogue"" for a while (i.e., served upon you according to his lecture specifications) this (as well as his essays) is fine reading concerning stylistics with respect to thoughts of the form ""whereof we cannot speak...""  but none of it is as thoroughly ""wittgensteinian"" as presented, and if mcdowell can still coherently be accused of rendering a disservice to that philosopher this heavily syncretist work must be counted as one such.  i expect this is not the case, however, and as such cannot in good conscience recommend this book to interested readers: if you are in the grip of a worry, perhaps you should stay there, and if you feel differently perhaps being notified of your pseudo-problems will not help overmuch.  something of a lecture-stuffer.

"huh? what happened to the ingested fig? to the excrement in the park? to the severed thumb buried in the floor? yes these are major fuel sources that (up to a point) propel the plot forward. what happens, even in the broadest of terms, to the characters? to wally for instance? atmospheric yes and in some ways gripping but what a stinker of an ending.    for amazon to sell this book with (and by implication to compare it to) the exquisite ""shadow of the wind"" shows either a seriously impaired scheme for pairing books (set in 20th century europe seems the only obvious similarity) or a desperate attempt to pawn off an overrun of lousy books on the coat tails of a great one. fig cheater"	0
i'm an engineer.  i had the e-myth stuck in my head.  i knew how to run a business, therefore i could run a successful business.      guess what?  gerber is right!  knowing all the technical details of running a business is not enough!    this book is simply awesome!  it perfectly described my mentality and my motivations for starting a business (i've started 2 businesses).  i've worked for 10 different companies and consulted with more than 20 others.  the principles and patterns he describes match with reality.      if you are thinking about starting your own business you must read this book!  it can save you years of your life and untold amounts of $.  i lost my life savings starting my first business.  reading this book helped make my second business a success.    if you are a business owner, you must read this book.  chances are this book will help you understand yourself and your relationship with your company.  your company and your employees will benefit greatly.    i highly recommend this book to any business owner or person thinking of starting their own business!. gerber knows his stuff	1
doug montgomery got excellent statistical training at vpi. he also has a wealth of practical experience from his consulting work. his books on regression, statistical design and response surfaces are all well written and understandable to engineers. this 4th edition published in 1997 still contains all the useful information on factorial and fractional factorial designs. chapter 14 is a wonderful up-to-date chapter that covers important process optimization topics not often covered in traditional design of experiments books. this includes response surface methods, mixture experiments, evolutionary operation and taguchi methods. it does not require high level mathematics. highly regarded book on design for engineers	2
here's the scoop:    the stories and essays in the book are hilarious, but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing, and others have been added.  that's only part of the problem.    david sedaris narrates, and he has a very monotone voice.  if you sit there and listen carefully, you'll find the stories quite funny, but if you (like me) do mindless tasks while listening, you'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort.  then you'll have to go back and listen over again, only to tune out the next part.  amy sedaris has small voice parts in the stories, and her voice is much better at grabbing attention.  however, her parts are very small.  i wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate, because then this audiobook would be a gem. skip the audio version	2
"what a disastrously bad and unfunny novel.  the self-involved main character is pathetic and whiny, the ""plot"" is see-through and cliched, and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog.    when people criticize chick lit, this is exactly the kind of book they're talking about.  it's shallow to such a shocking degree than when it tries to take itself seriously, or stretches for a literary flourish, it's absolutely cringe-worthy.  i find it hard to believe the people who've praised it here actually read the same book.    this was given to me by an acquaintance shortly after my engagement.  she said she didn't really like it but thought it would be ""more my kind of thing.""  obviously not a person who knows me well.  thankfully, it doesn't appear the author is terribly prolific, so readers don't need to worry about trying to stumble through page after page of show-offy navel-gazing.    i wouldn't say it's one of the worst books i've read, but it's certainly one of the most useless. they killed trees for this?"	0
"this book was awful. the author is a bad writer in general. also, as you can tell from her scary emaciated grin on the back of the book, she is not recovered. this means that she cannot distance herself from her disorders and therefore can't really write about them well. there is a tinge of smugness in her account, like, ""look how thin i am, i just can't eat."" it's boring and it's about a really lame person...she is incapable of living her life at all. she still lived with her parents for the majority of her life. bad one"	0
this novel tells the haunting story of two generations of a wisconsin family brought together and torn apart by the lake adjacent to the family home.  focused on four women, sisters of two generations, the novel develops around the sisters' relationship with the lake, and the tragedy that ensues when it claims one of their lives.  much of the book is spent untangling the secrets which led to the drowning, and working out the complicated problems which arise from the family's attempts to keep these secrets.      scwartz's story jumps back and forth across time, from past to present and back again.  this means that the story develops piece by piece, and this is what makes it something of a mystery.  i found the plot development to be one of the more satisfying parts of this book, seeing the pieces of the puzzle fall into place.  i enjoyed the developments leading up to scwartz's telling of what actually happened the night of the tragedy.  after that point, however, i found the plot to be something of a let-down.  the conclusion seemed a bit too neat, and a bit forced.      the most enjoyable part of this book to me was the way in which scwartz set the scene- the way in which she managed to capture the sense of a time and place.  the novel is set in the wisconsin countryside in the first half of the twentieth century, with most of the action focusing on the last years of wwi, and the 1920s.  scwartz offers a convincing portrait of wisconsin farm country in the late-1910s and early 1920s.  her descriptions are vivid, without being overstated, and her story intersects with several significant historical events, including wwi and the influenza epidemic.  scwartz gives her readers a strong sense of connection to the seasons, the land, the lake.  i really did feel like i was part of the world about which she wrote.      overall, i enjoyed reading this novel.  the development of the plot engaged me, and the scenery captivated me.  i was a bit disappointed by the ending, but my reading was by and large time well spent. interesting time, interesting place	2
let me first say that i've done this program several times over the past few years, and stayed on it each time for at least 6 months. it did not do much for me. my physique did not change, nor did the way i felt. i'm in good shape anyway, but i certainly did not build muscle mass. as far as strength goes, there's no possible way to test whether these exercises really build strength or not. i suppose you could subjectively say whether you felt stronger doing day to day activities, or test yourself with weights but neither of those is optimal.     i'd say that if you want to exercise without apparatus, and are interested in improving your appearance, conditioning, energy levels etc that there are more effective ways of doing so. either ross enamait's books, or combat conditioning and combat abs would be an improvement. i do combat conditioning and combat abs  most days and they've done me a world of good as far as conditioning, strength and flexibility, which are all things miracle seven did not.  and, i don't spend more than 20 minutes a day doing them. for all the silly furey marketing techniques (and he's as egregious as they come regarding his advertising) a combination of both of those furey books will do far more for you than miracle seven, which is a very incomplete program that you'll need to add conditioning and flexibility work to. not for me thanks--a very incomplete, unsatisfying program	2
"`notes from the underground' is a formidable work of philosophy and of psychology, not to mention its worth as a novel. in the space of around one hundred pages, dostoyevsky manages to expound theories on reason, alienation, suffering, and human inaction. the book's importance and influence on generations of writers cannot be over-emphasised; sartre and camus are only two examples of people who have been directly influenced by this book.    the book is presented in two parts. part one `underground' is written in the form of the nameless narrator's rambling thoughts on reason and his claim that throughout history, human actions have been anything but influenced by reason. underground man's charge is that man values most the freedom to choose to act in opposition to reason's dictates. dostoyevsky's critique of reason then, although it demands attention and is somewhat difficult to follow, sets the philosophical foundations for the rest of the book.    part two `a propos of the wet snow' is much easier to read, as the narrator recounts three episodes which happened when he was fifteen years younger and working as a civil servant in st. petersburg. the first considers an incident in which an army officer insults him and goes on to detail underground man's subsequent internal anguish at his inability to commit an act of retribution. the second episode takes place at a farewell dinner for an acquaintance named zverkov. the narrator is utterly disgusted with the company in which he finds himself but despite this, he is unable - even though he desires it - to make them realise this. the third episode details underground man's brief, painful and emotional relationship with a prostitute.    dostoyevsky is refreshing in this book thanks not only to his incredibly powerful prose, but also for the intense but subtle way in which the stories reflect and indeed embody his philosophical theories. this dark and pessimistic portrayal of the nature of man may not sit very comfortably with many readers, however the ideas expressed in `notes from the underground' are as relevant and worthy of deliberation now as i am sure they were in 1864.

"alas, this book was a very disappointing reading.    its one of the biggest sins is having a misleading title. ""sql server architecture and internals"" ? forget it.    the first whole third of the book is win32 in a nutshell. it tells you about memory, processes, i/o and everything. but i already have my richter dog-eared all right, i wouldn't need a reminder in a book on sql server.    then, about the sql server. internals ? what a joke. the only internals that you would find are names of the dlls where this or  that sql server subsystem resides and a few hardcore debugger sessions to show you those dlls actually get loaded. uh-huh, thanks.     can you imagine a book on sql server internals which doesn't mention pages and/or extents ? in-depth description of different execution plans ? this is the one.     what this book really is, is 20 chapters worth of overviews for more or less known sql server features. average-to-good overviews of a less known features. uhm, architecture, internals ? nope - sqlxml, dts, notification services, cursors, transactions. take cursors - it says there are four types of cursors, you know, static, etc. and shows an sql snippet for each. that's basically it. take transactions - acid, isolation levels and usage hints. oh well, it could be worse...    difficult to say without reading other books by the same author (not that i have an urge any more), but it appears he has written a whole series of them. you find sentences like ""in my other book..."" all over the place. just love it:    [quote]  i must confess that i was conflicted when i sat down to write this chapter. i wrestled with whether to update the sqlxml coverage in my last book, which was more focused on the practical application of sqlxml but which i felt really needed updating, or to write something completely new on just the architectural aspects of sqlxml, with little or no discussion of how to apply them in practice. ultimately, i decided to do both things.  [/quote]    isn't it great ?    oh, the chapter on full-text search was hilarious. how about this:    [quote]  communication between sql server and microsoft search occurs via a full-text provider. this provider resides in sqlftqry.dll in the binn folder under your default sql server installation.  ...  the sp_fulltext_... system procedures interact with it via the undocumented dbcc callfulltext command  ...  table 16.1. dbcc callfulltext functions  [*** a table of function ids taking the entire page ***]  ...  as a rule, you shouldn't call dbcc callfulltext in your own code. the function ids and parameters listed above could change between releases   [/quote]    what a heck did i just learn ???    i thought this book would show me how to improve the performance of the applications that i write by knowing the database server architecture deeper. instead, i got a book of not so bad overviews of different things for which there either was no coverage in the previous books or the author thought a quick reminder would be nice.    to be fair, some of the discussions were reasonably interesting, like chapter 12 ""query processor"", but give me a break, it's like 40 pages in a 1000 pages book.    don't. a book of leftovers"	2
"ill wind by nevada barr is the third book in her anna pigeon series, and the fourth book that i've read.  the more i read of barr, the more impressed i am with her mysteries.    national park service ranger, anna pigeon, finds herself working in mesa verde national park, home of the anasazi ruins.  this is a delicate assignment, trying to share the park with the public, while protecting the delicate ruins.  when bad things start happening, one of the park employees claim it is the chindi (or spirits) of the anasazi, who are protesting the desecration of their sacred sites.  each of these events is preceded by the appearance of a ""spirit veil"" over the ruins the night before.  but when a fellow ranger is found dead under mysterious circumstances, the national park service calls in agent frederick stanton of the fbi.      there are many theories as to what is happening in mesa verde.  although unhappy spirits are not ruled out, the lack of truthfulness with almost everyone involved makes for lots of suspicious characters.    pigeon and stanton work together to a thrilling conclusion.    as with tony hillerman, i enjoy barr's novels in that they teach the reader something new with each book.  with ill wind, we not only learn more about the nps, but also, the mysterious anasazi and the ruins they left behind.  it's an unsolved mystery why this civilization lived here for 600 years, and then disappeared without a trace.  we also learn more about ranger anna pigeon with each book.  i would have given it five stars if it hadn't dragged a bit at the beginning.  still, i have already started reading another barr, flashback. murder in mesa verde..."	2

i usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  it was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  the dialogues were stilted. there was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  i agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  i don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo. not one of stuart woods best work	0

i found the book to be an endless and somewhat unnecessary attack on classical theism.  her notions of pauline theology, based on a platonic dualism, have been shown to be baseless.  the disparities and divisions of the church and society are not proven in her work to stem from classical theism, but are assumed.  the church which she diminishes has worked to bridge culturally created divisions, which she fails to admit to.  her pandering into pantheism and panentheism are also disappointing, for she reveals her true intention of not reforming the church, but espousing a new religion. some interesting insights....but based on faulty assumptions	0

the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it. survivor in death	0

curt flood forever changed the game of baseball with challenging baseball's status quo. it cost him,but he paved the way for every player that came after him. in fact as far as i'm concerned if you got the choice of leaving one team&going to another you owe this man a salute. brad snyder does a great job at breaking things down with how curt flood took baseball to court.  this books goes into detail about curt flood's life on the field&off of it. curt flood took what jackie robinson started&took the baton to a whole different level for the players that would come thereafter. this is a very well written&documentated book.  curt flood has never gotten his full due at all. a must read	1
rev. dyson  dissects the great black man of the last century and attempts to get some insight into how his image translates to modern america. i found the chapter concerning dr. king's embrace of democratic socialism to be enlightening, but i found the rev. dyson handing out alibis for king's adultery disappointing. equally mind blowing is dyson's using overblown language to assail the king family's efforts to control their loved one's image. i wonder why there are hard feelings, since dexter and coretta king talked to him for this book. this is an interesting character study that does draw some modern parallels, but would have been better if it were about 3 chapters shorter. this book is too fat	2
"abraham lincoln's life and career continue to fascinate and inspire americans.  richard carwardine's recent study: ""lincoln: a life of purpose and power"" joins a select number of outstanding works on lincoln written by a non-american scholar.  richard carwardine is the rhodes professor of american history at oxford university.  his book, fittingly, was awarded the lincoln prize, the first work of a british writer to be so honored.    professor carwardine's study tells little of lincoln's private life: his marriage, prior relationships with women, his personal interests, his depression, his sexual orientation, and other issues that have been explored in some recent works.  he seems to presuppose a knowledge in his readers of the rudimentary facts of lincoln's life. (a duel in which lincoln participated as a young man is mentioned twice in passing but never developed.)  instead, professor carwadine explores lincoln's public career, before and during his presidency, and tries to develop the traits of character and the circumstances that made lincoln what he was.    thus, professor carwardine devotes a great deal of attention to lincoln's overwhelming ambition -- noted by virtually every writer on this subject -- and his desire to make something of his life through work and effort.  professor carwardine also emphasizes lincoln's shrewdness, knowledge of human nature, ability to present himself, and facility at working with and blending together disparate groups and ideas.  these pragmatic, practical abilities would prove essential to the tasks lincoln was called upon to perform as president.    professor carwardine emphasizes as well another, more thoughtful side of lincoln.  his book describes lincoln's role as a leader who endeavored to shape and mold public opinion rather than to be led by it. professor carwarding describes the fundamental role that moral conviction played in lincoln's political career -- in his lifelong belief in the evil of slavery and in his devotion to the cause of democracy and the union.  the book describes well the development of lincoln's religious convictions as he assumed the burdens of his presidency.  from his origins as a skeptic and freethinker, lincoln developed a sense of a just and providential god directing the course of human events for reasons of his own. lincoln's theology dovetailed at some point with america's evangelical protestantism, even though lincoln never became a traditional believer or practicing christian.  lincoln's religious sense and moral fervor, for professor carwardine, became essential to the leadership he provided during the civil war, as evidenced by the emacipation proclamation and the second inaugural address, among much else.    professor carwardine offers an insightful portrayal of american life during civil war times, particularly in middle-america as he discusses lincoln's rise to power in illinois and the 1858 debates with stephen douglas.  he shows how lincoln evolved during his years as president and how both his moral vision and his sense for the politically practicable were essential to holding the union together and creating a sense of american nationalism.    as does much modern history and biography, professor carwardine is at pains to separate lincoln, the hero and the cultural icon, from lincoln the man, and from the facts of his life. but in spite of these efforts and of professor carwardine's own understated conclusions, this book presents the reader with a remarkable man and a remarkable life.  professor carwardine concludes: ""while he was certainly not reluctant to wield political authority, his practical policy grew from a strong sense of moral purpose, and his course as president was shaped not by impouslive, self-aggrandizing action or self-righteousness, but by deep thought, breadth of vision, careful concern for consequences, and a remarkable lack of pride.""

many reviewers on this site read tlgpe in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. (i happened to be 13 when i read it.) if one could be sued for intellectual forgery, lindsey would certainly be found at fault.    most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. after all, when we read tlgpe, we were young. we were searching and seeking. we didn't have all of the facts. there were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'.    for most of us, our minds matured. we began to see the vast chinks in lindsey's pompous christian armor. we began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.    this is beyond dangerous. it is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.    i love a good horror novel. i love a good 'true crime' thriller. but the fact that people read lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions i have ever imagined.    that, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of lindeys 'books'. the only thing scarier is that mr. lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. please don't be the next sucker. please don't add this one to your cart. p l e a s e . . . buy something else	0
"because she is a real-life ""wife of,"" gigi levangie grazer has been hailed as the ""on the inside"" hollywood chick-litter. inexplicably, it turns out, because ""the starter wife"" is full of the vapid, name-dropping superficiality that any housewife from nebraska could dream up.     gracie is a ""wife of"" -- wealthy, toned, dyed and perfectly preserved, and married to a hollywood heavyweight with one kid. until kenny hits midlife crisis -- he dresses loudly, gets an earring, and then tells gracie that he wants a divorce. in the dizzying whirlwind of divorce, gracie finds out that he's having an affair with britney spears (presumably in the months before she started slumming it with kevin whatsisface).     a concerned pal lends gracie her malibu house, so the newly-divorced can get her bearings and life back on track. and as she wanders the california beaches with her gay pal and married neurotic friend, gracie finds herself desired by not just one but two men -- a handsome homeless man, and kenny's dissatisfied has-it-all boss. can she become more than kenny's ""starter wife""?     okay, it has a different plot -- one that shar jackson might find emotional satisfaction in, admittedly. but the core of ""the starter wife"" is yet another thin plot, with a moronic heroine and lots of name-dropping. it's even worse that much of grazer's name-dropping is out of date -- since this book went to press, brad and jen have broken up. so no one's worried about them procreating.     grazer's lack of inspiration shows through in the storyline itself, which meanders aimlessly between hollywood-expose cliches and middle-aged-woman-reinvents-self cliches. the writing meanders as well, as if the author is desperately trying to fill up space. grazer even has the excruciating taste to name gracie's gay pal ""will."" it's not witty or cute, just embarrassing.     perhaps the biggest flaw is that gracie -- the wronged wife of-turned-starter wife -- is a pill. despite the men going gaga over her, the supposedly smart gracie comes across as a bitter airhead, obsessed with age even when she's feeling good about herself. kenny is a cliche of the selfish ex, while will is a cliche of the lovable gay pal. only lou, a tired mogul who wants to know what people really think of him, comes across as a real person.     with more hollywood tale-telling and absurd cliches, gigi levangie grazer slumps even further in her sophomore effort. sure it's just a fluff book, but it's really bad fluff. don't get me started!"	0
it's taken me a while to get through this book partly because i'm not very excited about the plot and partly because the author's self-conscious writing style really annoys me. there are lovely phrases here and there, but there are plenty of others that read like something you'd find in a greeting card--they try hard to impress and fail. the author makes deliberate, almost constant use of foreshadowing, perhaps in an attempt to get the reader to stick with the book and not lay it down for good. i'm contemplating the latter. prose that's proud of itself	2
i got this book when my son was 2 months old. i find this book very helpful, especially for first time moms. the book is very clear, it tells you when to start your baby on solids, how much to give and how to prepare it, and much more. great book	1
i will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. it also has a lot of repetition in it. you can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... the fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what i am looking for in a book. how to use sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help. not a developer book	2

"the author comes off as a whining, unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling' church environment; further apalled by the church founder's belief, in that it (the worlwide church of god) was god's true church through the ages, right on up to the present 'end time'. feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on herbert w. armstrong,the church's actual teachings, and a general trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the general denomination as a whole, labeling it a 'cult'...and further damning its pastor general as a ""heretic"", despite the church's humanitarian works, publishing, colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of h.w. armstrong. since armstrong's death in 1986, feazell and his cohort joseph tkach jr. seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains, and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic holy days, sabbaths, ten commandments (which, in his estimation are now the 'ten suggestions') and general lifestyle of this 7th day church of god denomination. mr. feazell apparently does not speak for all the church membership, as over 100,000 members left and formed various smaller independent church of god conferences throughout the united states...and continuing the legacy and apostolic, traditional christian system of worship restored by herbert w. armstrong in 1927.  recommended reading: ""autobiography of herbert w. armstrong""; ""mystery of the ages""; ""the incredible human potential"". from christianity...to 'churchianity'"	0
this is an excellent book. i have had the grace to see first hand two of the incorruptibles whose stories are detailed here by joan carrol cruz (saint catherine laboure and st. bernadette soubirous), and not even this wonderful book can prepare you for the experience.    while her research is sound, even first rate, cruz has an easy to read prose that does not descend to the dry and academic. although cruz's style is reverent, at times even bordering on devotional, this is an excellent book for catholic and non-catholic alike, skeptic and believer. fascinating	1
excellent autobiography that should be required reading! mr mandela has written thorough life history of himself and of the struggle for freedom and equality in south africa. as long as it was, i just couldn't put it down.    highly recommended!. long walk...worth the trip!	1
back in his day heinlein was the greatest writer of science fiction for adolescent boys. unfortunately, that day is long past, and heinlein has wandered far from his strength.  this book fills in some gaps from time enough for love and is a rehash of much of that story from an alternate viewpoint.  as was the case in time enough for love, sexual coupling of old men and young girls is a recurring theme. examples: the two female lead characters brag to one another how they had their first sexual experience at ages 12 and 14 and with men 4 times their age.  the male lead goes back in time and has sex with his sister, then a young teen, and he, at this point, the oldest man in human history.  to make all this go down easier, the young females are the sexual aggressors and the old men are pursued, and said to be 'tripped' if she has her way with him.  there is a lot more of this 'weird sex', but i will move on.  this is not really a science fiction story per se, but there are a few trappings of science fiction used to decorate the story.  most of it takes place in the first half of the 20th century in mid america.  there isn't really a plot.  the book is a series of anecdotes occuring in the life of this unlikely heroine, seemingly heinlein's feminine ideal.  it is obvious that the author has run out of ideas at this late point in his career.  this book would not have been published if it was the work of an unknown author. out of ideas	2
i actually quite enjoyed this book until the last few pages. the individual stories of the pilgrims are relatively interesting (if a bit clumsy), all having some connection with hyperion. progress towards the story's climax on hyperion seemed slow, but i assumed there would be some kind of closure to the story, which would also lead on to the next book in the series. sadly, there is no closure to the story, leaving me feeling cheated. most authors are able to find a good balance between providing a satisfactory ending to one story, and leaving you keen for the next one. most annoying of all, the author completely pulled me out of his fictional world by dropping in a trite and annoying reference to 20th century fiction at the very end. i felt like the joke was on me, the author was deliberately trying to disrupt my suspension of disbelief. i'm disappointed, i feel betrayed by the cheap ending, and i shan't bother reading any further in the series. disappointing	2
"i really enjoyed this book.it was bound to be published,sooner or later.if the library of alexandria did not burn and collapse,society would have seen this kind of book much sooner.many rebels and magicians would have withered in the piazza's stockades,for circulating such an explosive tome about nature.let it be published!through christianity and islam and communism,these power structures have done nothing to promote world peace and caring for the environment.those institutions destroy the haptic pagan ,who then becomes numb to the ways of nature and her earth-magick.scott cunningham has became a lightening rod for ridicule by the pudibund neo-right.the average wiccan today ,was still wearing nappies,when scott passed away.he would be amazed and delighted by the growth of the old religion today. some potentially good wiccans of the 60's were stymied by drifting into the red army faction,malcolm x's panthers and the kirshna-moonies.this is a great beginners book for all open-minded people ,who want to channel their energies in a more positive way.when one destroys an aspect of nature,one destroys part of the whole cosmic-web,in which we all live on. wicca is not about devil-worshipping,or a gateway path into satantism.nor an idle trip into lotusland.the amusing hollywood b-flicks ,hash-out alot of the wrong sterotypes about true wicca.latest being the ridiculously inaccurate ,""wicker-man"" movie.use this book as a primer, and then research for more advanced wiccan studies.-as jim morrison once said,""you're all a bunch of slaves!"".so,wiccans of the earth unite! you have nothing to lose but your chains of ignorance!. best  book for  christian slaves rediscovering the natural earth "	1
"what was an exciting adventure novel back in the 1970's for a young pre-teen (was i ever so young?) on re-reading now turns out to be a silly james bond knock-off/summer beach book. the most grating conceit is the author's habit of giving every *single* female charactor a ""clever"" name (anna bidet - french, randi knickers-english, jemima brown-african american, etc...). it hasn't aged well. didn't hold up over the years"	2

"i probably would have never read this book had i not received it as a gift.  however i am a fan of the occult and unexplained phenomenon, so i gave it a shot.  the book is entertaining; if only for the fact that her assertions about things like crop circles, the pyramids, and atlantis are outlandish and fanciful.  her research is morbidly flawed, she sites several websites, and never bothers to site any credible references.  it's important to note that the book has no bibliography.  many of her conclusions are a result of information received from her spirit guide francine, and it occurred to me many times while reading this book that perhaps sylvia should take what francine has to say with a grain of salt.      the book is rather light on content.  she tackles several ""secrets & mysteries"", however only dedicates a few pages to each.  her chapter on alien abductions is barely three pages long.  for someone really looking to delve into unexplained phenomenon, there are plenty of books out there which explore these things in much greater detail and with more credibility.  but if the book happens to fall into your hands, you might as well read it.  it's good for some chuckles.  (of course, it's not supposed to be funny. entertainment and nothing more"	2
i give this book 4 stars because i still have alot of questions and skepticism in some of the wildly, new to me, ideas in this book.  i like sylvia brown's deep sense of spirituality and her abilities have convinced me she is real at what she does. i don't think she is trying to fool anyone.  i am a seeker and am approaching the things she talks about in this book with as much an open mind as i possibly can be. the chapter on the lost continent of atlantis was the chapter that was pushing me the most.  although i do believe there is life in the universe beyond our own the atlantis story is really out there.  of course, i have not done any reading about this subject before so who am i to judge it. there maybe very similar views in other books about atlantis and her explaination did make sense when compared the ages of people of atlantis to those in the book of genesis reaching in the 800 and 900 yrs old.  from crystal skulls to loch ness monster to spontaneous human combustion it is all an interesting and fun read!!  but if you buy this book you will have to take what you can use and just leave the rest. open minded as i possibly could be!	2

"although i agree with much of what ms. seaman writes about synthetic estrogen, (made from mares' urine,) and progestin, (synthetic progesterone), i strongly disagree that all estrogen is potentially ""dangerous"" to the female body.  (pls. see dr. uzzi reiss's comments on bio-identical estrogen in his wonderful book, natural hormone balance for women, in which he, (dr. reiss), states:  ""currently estrogen is ""under attack"" as a major risk factor in the epidemic of breast cancer.  i find this ludicrous.  estrogen is the hormone that distinguishes women's unique gender.  after 2 million yrs. of human evolution, could the female hormone suddently have turned into a serial killer?  would nature suddenly decide to create a one-gender species?  of course not.  incriminating estrogen is as logical as saying that your liver is the cause of liver cancer."" (p. 28 of dr. reiss's book).  i thoroughly agree with dr. reiss.  i, (along with something like 70% of women in menopause), had terrible symptoms of insomnia, lack of energy, lethargic depression, muscle/joint pain, and minor anxiety.  it took me two yrs. of physical symptoms to finally discover bio-identical estrogen, and i consider it a ""lifesaver.""  it has literally given me back my sense of who i was before menopause.  within 1-1/2 hrs. of taking the hormone, i became in control of my mind and mood again, regained my stamina, slept better than i had in 2 yrs., and within a few days started to lose the excess wt. i had gained. my recommendation is that in addition to ms. seaman's book, readers might like to read dr. reiss's book, (from a purely clinician point-of-view,), rather than just a political one. hooray for tri-est!! (name of the bio-identical estrogen formula i used). ms. seaman does not discuss bio-identical hormones"	0
how can a best-selling author like simon winchester take an event as exciting as the san francisco earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? one answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but simon winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about simon. simon and the raccoons; simon on the failing american economy; simon attempting to reproduce american accents. this is a cd set for avoiding. dreadfully boring	2

halley uses 17,000 ft. high mt. ararat in eastern turkey as noah's ark's final resting place when the bible says mountains of ararat in the book of genesis. also, old traditions attribute the ararat range to a different area than where mt. ararat (formerly mt. masis) is located.     on other points he talks about humankind seemingly only 6,000 years old (as most biblical versions claim if generations are taken literally in genesis). well, like another book written in the early 1960's (the genesis flood) this book is out of date badly on the age of humankind as dna studies have since totally proven human life is much older than the few thousand years these books claim. unlike the genesis flood this book seems to reflect the author's real genuine beliefs. gets mt. ararat wrong	2
"subtitled ""a scientist's search for common ground between god and evolution,"" this book is a thoughtful and serious attempt to resolve the question of whether a sincere christian (or adherent of any other western religion, which is his main focus) can also accept darwinian evolution. in the first chapter, miller recounts his religious catholic upbringing, his introduction to darwin (dogged by warnings that he was reading a ""dangerous"" book), and his later decision to enter the field of biology.     the next part of the book looks at the development of the scientific method and the theory of evolution, as well as painstakingly and devastatingly refuting the three major schools of opposition to it. he shows that the proponents of these ""alternatives"" misunderstand and distort science, continue using obsolete arguments long after they are debunked, and make no effort to do scientific research of their own while demanding that their ideas be accepted as science. he also argues that they present profoundly flawed pictures of god, as evidenced by his chapter titles: ""god the charlatan,"" ""god the magician,"" and ""god the mechanic.""    miller also tackles head-on the most legitimate beef of the anti-evolutionists, the use of ""darwinism"" by many scientists to attack religion and to claim that if nature can be explained and understood, god is proven not to exist or life proven to be purposeless. he feels that it is as wrong to make these claims as it is to attempt to use science to ""prove"" that god does exist.    the final third of the book is devoted to a passionate and well thought out case that acceptance of the truth of evolution is not only not a bar to a sincere and committed religious outlook, but can be, in conjunction with other areas of science, an affirmation of it. i won't try to summarize or do justice to his argument here, but i believe that many who are more traditional than i am will find it convincing. i don't think that miller will convert any atheists to his point of view, but that is not his purpose. what he is doing is reaching out to believers and offering them a place at the table instead of antagonizing them and pushing them away, without compromising his scientific integrity. his obvious enthusiasm for science and love of god make him a perfect person to do this, and given that people are most belligerent when they feel that their core beliefs are being threatened, it seems to me to be a very sensible course to follow. passionate and thoughtful"	1

i've been a fan of w.c. fields since my youth.  there was always something about him, a certain style that he had on screen, that was unique.    this book does tell the truth behind the real w.c., and dispells many of the myths that still are current about him.  he was a man that was in turn cantankerous, gentle, funny and poignant.      i for one never realized that he was such an avid reader.  books seemed to be his passion, and all during his world travels as a vaudeville juggler he carried trunks of books along the way.  anyone that reads so voraciously is bound to be an interesting personality.  his vast reading no doubt contributed to his comedy that involved the word play for which he is famous.  it is astounding to know that for many years in the early part of his career when he was a juggler, that he did his act in almost total silence!      a great biography that reveals the unique character that was w.c. fields.  written in a very readable style, we can learn about this man, warts and all through this book.    highly recommended. a very good biography of a unique person	1
mr. minter comes through again with a hard hitting reporting style that comes up with stories that aren't reported adequately elsewhere in the media. taking investigative journalism to places that other pontificators only dream about richard minter tells more stories about the war on terror that americans need to read. in a style somewhere between tom clancy and bill gertz, minter delivers style and prose that is easy on the brain, flowing and captivating. i was glued to the pages. it was an enjoyable read that provided a great perspective into many under-reported aspects of the war.    his bias leaks through as a conservative and hawkish but the prose doesn't come across as an ideologue. he backs his information up with interviews and facts and provides supportive information that i found to be entirely persuasive. the material is well researched and he presents an exceptional bibliography for further reading. this is a book that everyone should read, conservatives and democrats alike. minter finds pieces and interviews that no one else has and this niche makes for great exploration of the subject materials at hand. perspective reporting that are way better than the well worn war stories	1

my husband picked this book up since he remembers it well from his childhood. he wanted it in our classic collection for our children ~~ and this book definitely belongs there. it is a classic novel about life. the narrator ends up in the desert and while looking for water, he runs into a little boy, who just happened to be from another planet. and this is his story.    this is an observation of what it means to live. this is a story that pokes fun at businessmen, kings and so on ... but at the same time, it provides a sad truth that a lot of people miss when rushing around in life. the little prince talks about tending his own planet that only has one flower on it. he talks about love. he talks about hope and dreams. it is a very vivid story that makes you stop and think. and it is a classic ~~ i recognize the truths even sixty years after it was first published. it is still the same as it was then. life is too short to fret over everything.     this is definitely a book everyone should read at one time or another and plan to re-read it over the years, as a reminder that life is precious.     10-27-0. a classic	2

"i found this book to be based on a kernel of truth wrapped in innumerable layers of unconfirmable speculation (how many people really have access to intelligence agency archives?) and one-sided 'analysis'.  it is clear the bin ladin was 'lost' at tora bora when our troops were called back to garrison, allowing him to escape.  this goes even farther to the right than micheal moore goes to the left.    if you want a look at the subject from someone who was involved through several administrations, read ""against all enemies: inside america's war on terror"" by richard clarke.    if you buy this book, you are paying for propaganda. damage control for the current president"	0
like many of the other reviewers, i found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  however, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.    what's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.      interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  a good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great. mediocre... good for healthy advice, bad for recipes.	2

do not read this book. i attempted to read this book for a college class. this book should be cut down to the size of a magazine article and be published in a scientific journal. the public should not be misled into thinking that this book is readable. it is written at too high of a diction, and griffin rambles on for 20 pages on one topic, which i won't spoil for those of you unfortunate to read this trash. the subject information is interesting, but this is written poorly, and will bore the reader to tears. just thought i'd let you all know. do not read this book	0
i brought this book to kill some time on holiday.  but when i picked it up i could not put it down.  bob norris, an experienced naval aviator is also a pretty good author which is not often the case when these millitary types pick up a pen. the novel describes a fly off competition to pick a new fighter/bomber but all is not as it seems as the hosts have a hidden agenda.  each fighter/bomber has 5 events to prove it's worth and the one fault this book has is bob should have put more flying sequences into the competion events instead of just giving a brief summary of what they did and the results in some cases.  the parts of the novel dealing with the fly offs are top drawer and if you like your aviation in books then read fly off. keep those books coming mr norri. well written mr norris	2
this is the 5th book in the rapp series (i've read them in order), and it is definitely the best so far.  the story is highly entertaining and action packed from the very beginning.  flynn's previous efforts, while still very good, have all left something to be desired.  transfer of power was a little slower moving, third option and separation of power were too drawn out and should have been written as one novel, and executive power just wasn't a terrific story.  memorial day does not have any of these flaws.  all the strengths of his previous efforts are present without any of the weaknesses.    if you are an anti-military, excessively pc, or pro-bureaucracy, this sort of book is not for you.  but if you are a fan of 24, like one reviewer mentioned, you will be a big fan of the entire rapp series.  i give it an easy five stars.  can't wait to start consent to kill and act of treason. flynn's best effort so far	1
this nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective.  the research is suspect.  the prose amateurish.  the details gossipy and contrived. if eleanor roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. if you're looking to understand roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work. how did this ever become a national bestseller?	0
i'm not sure why anyone would want or need a phb2... i mean, come on.  the whole reason 3.5 came out was to make money with little regard to how to better the game, and this book follows that example very well.  the content is mostly all fluff, about the only thing redeeming about this book is the cover. garbage	0
this was a brilliant book.  the language was much shorter and more precise than in road to serfdom.    i know that it was one of hayek's traits to not use mathematics, but it would have been nice if he demonstrated some of his ideas with at least a little math. or gave us the references if we wanted to look them up right at the bottom of the page.    particularly neat was his off-setting things that were not critical to the argument in small type.    as it stands, the book is almost 100% empirical evidence of why socialism doesn't work. and kudos to the author for calling socialism and communism what they are, which is religion. better than road to serfdom	1
"although many readers have commented on elizabeth (a truly captivating character), her husband isaac has been given short shift. he appears in one of the book's most poignant scenes as he straightens up after the rosh hashana dinner and, in an act of private accounting, chastises himself for his reluctance to support his wife in her desire to open a store. analyzing his failings with the same critical eye he might bring to a scholarly text, isaac then resolves to mend his ways. this scene is almost unsurpassed in its portrayal of a tender and intensely religious jewish sensibility (surpassed, in my reading, only by chaim grade in the closing section of the second novella in his magnificant  ""rabbis and wives""). this is what a loving marriage is about"	1

the general feeling i had left after reading through this graphic novel was, that was it? costing anywhere between 17 and 25 bucks this title hardly pays for itself. the book overall has a couple of different stories split up, all set in the halo universe. a good way to describe this book is, it's like the animatrix, short stories based in a specific fictional landscape that are at best, cool and at worst mediocre. the art in every one of these short stories in this book were all top notch but, the shortness of the short stories just left me with again, the feeling of: that's it? my suggestion to halo fans out there? wait till this comes out in trade paperback form when it'll be about 10 bucks, then it might be worth buying. art is great, story....not so much - buy when paperback comes out	2
from the first few pages, i knew that i'd stumbled on to something that was going to be extremely beneficial to me. the themes in this book are so relevant and i felt relief everytime i read something that was familiar to experience.    angry women get this book. anger no more	2
"i figured if oprah wanted america to read this book that it couldn't be too bad. i had held out on reading faulkner, and now i know why. i read alot and love reading but this book, and ""as i lay dying"" makes me question why oh why faulkner is a classic. my hypothesis is that its so unapproachable therefore people think it must be brilliant. this is a good book for english class when you can sit around and discuss the meanings of it all and read sparknotes together. this is not a book for sitting at home and reading for yourself. if you want to know the story just go read the sparknotes version. the book itself is too hard to figure out and there is little plot. its just a long headache really. why a classic?"	2
a masterful volume.  the breadth and scope of this work leaves one breathless.  oh, if only the world would read and understand this - we'd all be better off.. the bible of economics	1
"i actually read this entire book just to see if/how beatrice would get what was coming to her. yes, the book is about incest. the ads and cover i've seen for this book state something like ""murder, incest, betrayal"" or something like that so it should come as no shock that it is about incest. the thing i didn't like was that about 2/3 of the book seemed to be about nothing but sex. sex scene after sex scene. i frankly belive it's better to leave it to the imagination. we all know what happens when you have sex. but really it seemed more wrong that beatrice and her brother acted like a couple in love. it wasn't just the incest that was gross. gregory's descriptions of other physical things left me queasy at times. after everything, i think what beatrice did to her husband had to be one of the vilest acts i've ever read. this book was at the most okay and i do not recommend it. the most disgusting character ever"	2
"this book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering ""why?"" protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer ethan frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. he finds some ""excitement"" when mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  to recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for the happy ending. instead, wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. i feel like i wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. why???. don't waste 3 hours of lifespan reading this book"	0
i returned  from my 6th visit to istanbul a couple of days ago. i took along pamuk's book thinking it might be fun to read about the city  during my stay... this  is not really a fun book to read, though it is a good one. as one reviewer pointed out the translation is very well done.  the style is smooth and flowing. if you can't visit istanbul in the grips of winter, pamuk's  book will give you some idea of what it is to walk alone through this great cities back streets and alleyways  and to  feel history  rising up to meet you at every  turn. there really is a special melancholia to istanbul in the winter and pamuk captures it  perfectly. huzun redux.	2
the author could have added so many details that were factual and actual events and, yet, were so compelling and riveting.  this book lacked substance and depth.  you don't really experience the life or the personal conflicts that played out in the french court.  it was also too sympathetic to marie antoinette and highly unbelievable.  there were also so many missing pieces that could have explained more clearly what led up to the revolution.  i know this is a work of fiction but the true historical events and figures that took place were much more interesting than all the fictional events and characters the author created. history buff	2
"the first line in the book talks about rain as a torrential torrent.  it gets worse.  but who am i to say?  i quit on page 39, shortly after the black belt 72 year aunt old scares the traumatized dog into the bath by putting on a ninja mask and jumping into the kitchen screeching, ""eyowwww.""  beyond awful. torrential torrents and other nonsense"	0
i'm not surprised that many of the reviewers here gave the books such high marks.  their reviews, much like the book, are littered with misspellings and other inaccuracies.  perhaps we can blame this on the evil conservative right-wing establishment known as our education system....oh, wait....it's largely liberal?  holy cow.  oh, sorry, a religious reference.  shame on me. pathetic	0
this is a very well designed book for an art teacher with small children. it gives lots of ideas for art projects. art classes for young children	1
mr. griffin has a formula.  one formula, with one character and nothing changes.  this book, the entire series, and in reality all of mr griffin's work is nothing more than the literary equivalent of marshmallow creme only with less flavor and nutritive value.  i recommend it for use as a soporific or in a pinch toilet tissue. nothing new in this series	0
crying of lot 49  flat - senseless - one dead accumulation of words - in,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. a book worthy of burning.   has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness  poor plot  poor writing    read - umberto eco's foucaults pendulum. if you are looking for conspiracy.  do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth). censor the garbage	0
musty, dated, old boy humor of the kind floating around breakrooms and water-coolers. this stuff wasn't funny when the vaudeville hacks were doing it. i like mr.asimov, and probably would have been somewhat charmed by his delivery(maybe). all in all, read benchley or woody allen again for literary laughs and leave asimov for the 3000 other genres he dabbled in. eye of the beholder	2
the biggest disappointment of this book is that the comments about the cia - training and operation - are akin to what might have been written at the end of the day into a diary.  there was passage after passage that begged for insight that her (limited) experience brought, but i don't remember a single case of finding this.  the criticism of the cia training is rendered in terms of the students' shortcomings in the exercises, with no thought to why they didn't do better, or if their performance - while not good - was in fact passable.    i suspect that the people from the intelligence agencies that gave high marks to this book are doing so because they find the public criticisms of the cia refreshing and useful/needed, and that they could fill in the insights on their own.    despite having read multiple of the reviews here, i was still unprepared for the sheer amount of time talking about her personal life (one reviewer overstates it as being 75%) and how trite it was.    the reviews here had prepared me for the arrogance of a 30-something, but what i encountered was more the self-absorption of a teenager.  the librarian who shelfed this book in the teen section may have been making a different editorial comment than the reviewer (2006-aug-15) who reported it (reviewer gave it 5 stars for the teen reader).    the book has many hints and clues that the author is substantial and interesting, and this may keep you reading. however, that person never emerges. in the mode of a teenage girl's diary	0
the professional edition appears to be missing any information on at least 2 new photoshop cs2 features; smart sharpening and reduce noise. it has sections on sharpening and noise but does not cover the new cs2 commands. i have not been through the whole book but this situation took me by surprise. disappointed	0
it really made me think.  as a rule, i don't read religious books, but since this one was recommended to me, i ordered it.  i wasn't sorry.  it's an easy read, and i enjoyed it very much. fascinating!!	2
i purchased this book to find out about the publishing industry and more effectively market my book.  without mr. kremer's book i would have been clueless, however now i am well informed and continue to sell my book.  it has been picked up for a second edition by another publisher, which was my main goal.  ( i self published as a quick way to get review copies out to the public and get the book rolling)i knew the world needed my book and i needed it releasedquick.  mission accomplished.  i keep 001 ways close to my side and continuously consult it as i continue my publishing journey.  highly recommended to anyone who wants to sell books and be successful and effective in the process. incredible book	1
i thought this was a very good book and would recommend it to anyone who likes this type of book. great read	1
"considered by many who should know (e.g., e. m. forester)to be woolf's most brilliant work of genius, the waves is a challenging book to read for many reasons, not the least of which is the style she has adopted. more like an extended greek chorus than anything else, the six characters, whose ""voices"" sound identical to one another, speak their life stories in short, alternating monologues.  although the writing is very poetic, it is also very dense and very distancing. we never really warm up to any of the characters or get involved in their stories.    i had to read this book for a class and, though i'm glad i made it through to the end, it was difficult going and i know i never would have finished it (or even gotten through ten pages of it) if i hadn't had the carrot of a grade hanging over it. we had to read the whole thing in a week which is really not a good way to tackle this book. best read in small segments, leisurely, absorbing each moment woolf choses to highlight. definitely not a plane or beach book!    if you haven't read woolf before, this is not the book to start with.  mrs. dalloway is, in my opinion, the best and most accessible of woolf's experimental fictions and a good starting place for access into this great 20th century author's works. then, if your brave, move onto ""to the lighthouse"" and then, shudder, ""the waves. a toughie.

"after watching the film, ""finding neverland"", i was curious to learn more about the fates of the 5 boys orphaned in the story.  although barrie did not gain custody of the boys, he did maintain a strong presence in their lifes. in fact, he did much more than just keep an eye on them over the years.  he showered them with gifts; traveled with them; and of course, financially helped them.  he seemed particularly obsessed with the older boy, george.  barrie loved to photograph all of the boys and some of the photos included in this book show the children naked.  was barrie a pedophile of sorts?  none of the boys ever accused him of such.  and barrie's love and concern for the boys did not end when they became men who were tall enough to tower over the diminutive playwright.      this is a comprehensive look at barrie's life without passing any judgement.  that is left to the reader.  and after reading this book, i have to say that i'm still unable to figure the man out.  he is an enigma.  there are tons of photographs - one or two on just about every page.  original correspondence and notes from barrie's diary/journals add further insight.  a fascinating, and sometimes tragic look back in time. a brilliant but flawed man"	2
"i love the review before mine by comiccostumes, the one line dis-- i've read his other review of a japan anime video where he commends the ""well placed panty shots.""  i can see how bare disappointed him.  pornography it is not.  instead it is a woman examining sexuality, power, control and other dynamics in the context of five women that work in a seattle peep show.  it is a study of a culture not many of us get to see.  and, as comiccostumes learned, little of it has to do with lust for sex.  for some it has to do with survival, for others power, for others simply a freedom to feel good about themselves and their bodies.  for the men on the receiving end of the lap dance it must come as a real let-down. truly a great read, but pornography it is not"	2
"immediately upon starting dickens' ""our mutual friend,"" i was struck by parallels with dumas' ""the count of monte cristo.""  both big novels revolve around a powerful character who conceals his identity in a complicated plot to obtain social justice.  the count deals with the darker theme of revenge.  our mutual friend is an exploration of the corrupting influence of wealth.    the novel is lively throughout, as  dickens displays his tremendous diversity of writing talents.  the tone ranges from heavily ironic criticism of upper-class politics and antisemitism, to delicate romance, to witty visual humor.  the characterizations are highly original; even those at the extremes of vice and virtue display engaging ideosyncracies.    most impressive to me was the consistency of dickens' plot.  our mutual friend was written and published in installments, as was the count of monte cristo.  but dickens keeps his story on track throughout, never dropping a character, while dumas' tale is full of gaps and inconsistencies. the complete dickens"	1
"i love due and this was no exception. the between is powerful, wonderfully written and extremely creative.     in her first novel, due sets the stage for the consequences of what could happen (both mentally and physically)if you could change your fate and cheat death. we are introduced to hilton james, whose memories of his beloved grandmother are haunting and confusing...he sees her dead in their kitchen, only to get help and find her alive and cooking at the stove. years later, he is still troubled by these memories and seeks professional help from his psychiatist/friend. while attempting to salvage his fragile mind, he is overwhelmed with events that change, memories that are not real (cheating on his wife), and events that did not (in reality it would seem) occur, his wife, a candidate for a judgeship is being threatened by a racist stalker. (there also appears to be a connection between hilton's powers and the stalkers.) loving his family and wanting what is best for them, he struggles to maintain his hold of reality. in a novel filled with ""parallel worlds, doorways to other dimensions and travelers"", hilton seems to be scared, confused and lonely. what we later learn is that hilton's grandmother (who rescued him from drowning and lost her life) appears to have suffered from the same type of events...she too appears to have the ability to cheat death. but as they say in final destination....you really can't cheat death, and that is why the end of the novel is so powerful. in the end, we see hilton once again faced with the option to ""cheat death"" or ""succumb"" and you should read this powerful, well written novel to see what he finally decides. brilliant!!!!!!"	1
this is one of the best collections i've read in years--perhaps the best since civilwarland.  saunders is an entirely unique voice--there really is no one else like him, and he manages to harness such disparate effects that it kind of leaves you breathless when finished.  you're stunned, sad, and above all laughing. saunders is a genius	1
i just finished reading this book, complaining the whole way how i did not like it.  i should have put it down, but i thought it had to get better at some point.  there was too much sex (graphic sometimes)and no substance.  while you were gone by sue miller was better. who cares.........	2
this book is one of the best i've ever read.  i rarely sit for an entire day to read a book but i just couldn't stop reading.  mr. richardson starts by explaining the culture of the yali tribe, then moves to the life and background of stan dale.  seeing the providence of god at work as the third part brings the yali tribe and stan dale together is remarkable.  stan dale's conviction, comittment, and compassion is something to inspire any believer concerned with spreading the gospel of jesus christ. an excellent story	1
"a serial killer's pedophilia leads him to disguise cop-suicides as murders and to toy with the investigators who unexpectedly begin to put together the pieces of his bizarre crime. connelly alternates between the first-person perspective of the reporter who first suspects that all is not as it seems and the point of view of the murderer. too much description of the plot will give away its many surprises, which come together in the ingenious final pages of the novel. suffice it to say that the book offers a potent mix of ingredients that will keep most any reader going: love, sex, death, envy, personal ambition.    all of the things that connelly does well come together in ""the poet"": his ability to craft a complicated plot that nonetheless fits together like clockwork, to build a mood, set a scene, put together a tight workmanlike sentence. best of all, the book displays his trademark noir hero whose own darkly human qualities make him the right man to locate the monster-killer whose trail he follows here. it's just perfect for the story that jack mcevoy, the protagonist, is a reporter who stands to benefit from uncovering the crime, and that it's his own good twin who was the original murder victim.    as almost every other reviewer here has mentioned, this book is a class-1 page-turner. i read it in a day while on vacation, never slowing down except to eat. what fun! it's also kind of a kick to see how far we have come in the past ten years from the ""cutting-edge"" technology that helps investigators solve the crime here (the book was published in 1996). despite the laptops that mcavoy and others lug around, jack has to read edgar allan poe's entire corpus during one sleepless night in order to identify the quotations the killer leaves as clues. today, of course, a ""google"" search would do the trick in about ten seconds. pack it for the plane ride"	1
i am not writing in english and try to learn some fiction writing skills. this book has cited many literay fiction and is a good source for you to find fictions good at dialogue, etc. but it provides very few techniques and you have to read  the referred literature to know how to write a dialogue. i jumped many paragraphs. i also can not agree with the author on what attract the readers. sometimes i feel the opposite about certain classics. other books i am reading provide me with many techniques such as techniques of selling writer and immediate fiction. few techniques many examples	2
"i find it quite interesting the one reader who slams le ly is also the only reader in all of these posts who neglected to leave a name or email address. also the following statement was included ""the viet congs lied, tortured, and killed numerous innocent people to get what they want."" hmmmm that sounds like the exact same things the americans did! also the following statement is made ""it's pathetic how low she would go to make a buck off the same capitalist system that she and the communists despised do much that they had to engage in a war that turned many people's lives upside down, to drive the americans out"" that's kinda funny accusing the vietnamese of starting a war because it's likely there never would have been a war had americans stayed in america. the vietcong were no more worse human beings than the americans they were fighting against. the vietcong were true patriots no different than american patriots and visitors to vietnam today will find many ex-vietcong are friendly and civil to american visitors. a good book with one more account of how innocent people are effected by the war. a well written memoir of the horrors of war."	1
this is an extremely detailed book on allied (mainly british) deception operations during world war ii. while it was written in 1976 it still hold up well, though some new information on the role of gchq and signals intelligence has been released since 1976. i am still amazed at the scope of operations the british ran during world war ii. a very well written book, though it is by know means a quick read. it took me almost a month to get through it. if you are keenly interested in intelligence operations try to track down this book. the book on intelligence operations during world war ii	1
"this is a wonderful book for those kids who either have parents paying off all their teachers to pass them or the students that sleep with the right people to pass. oh, and i don't sit in my room on saturdays playing card games, either. but having fun doesn't mean ""get drunk 24/7 for four years"". there's something called having a life that this book totally misses but, well, it's for college kids, and they're mostly idiots. good for stupid people."	0

first of all, i think that anyone out there who is writing books about anti islam are just out there to make money. i would like to go back to what the author stated about the muslim world dictators. the question is who put them in power to eliminate the true values of islam? why today middle east is the target by the oppressors of the new world order? who puts these leaders in throne and try to bring democracy to a muslim world. what would happen if islamic constitution would establish in western world. it would be a scary scene for that part of the world. those who are muslims or studied islam knows that it is a religion of peace. the word jihad in islam corresponds to fighting against the devil who resides within all of us which is 90% of jihad and the other 10% of jihad is self defence. there is no conflict among any religion branch except those power hungry dictators. comon people lets not have a religious war, we are all the children of adam and beleive in one god. let us all join together to fight the devil who is here to destroy each individual of us. we must all wake up before it is too late and see what the soldiers of devil are doing to bring one world order and to enslave us under the devil government. peace to you all. misinterperation of jihad	0
"eugene o'neill may have been the father of american theatre, but the excellent writing he became known for is not portrayed in long day's journey into night. o'neill's characters were shallow, pathetic and seemed to have great moodswings.the father-son relationship between james tyrone and his son, jamie, is meanspirited, and they tend to blame eachother for the family problems. tyrone regularly refers to jamie as a useless failure, and a drunk, not only to his face but to other family members, and in turn jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son, edmund. tyrone says such things as ""you'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life!""(p.32) and comments to edmund that, ""if he's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey, he's never shown it.""(p.131). the characters of the parents are pathetic, the mother all fluttery and drugged, and the father as the stereotypical old, cheap, and mean failed celebrity. the only seemingly normal relationship is between edmund and jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love. the relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural, they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds. it is as if they entire family is bipolar.    long day's journey into night was based on the life of o'neill himself, with the character of edmund as o'neill. the mother of o'neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between o'neill and his older brother, and his father never accepted o'neill for who he was. these sad beginnings continued throughout the life of o'neill and was evident in the writing of this piece. if the characters in long day's journey into night are closely based on his family members then o'neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine. drunks + drug addict + dying son = one dysfunctional family."	0
as a big military history reader i have to say this book was excellent.  i don't recommend very many books but this was great especially for people already familiar with wwii.    it takes you inside the dfeat of the german army.  very great observations from high ranking german officer mixed with views from the foot soldier.    gives a great perspective on the german army and the internal divisions it had. a book that stands out among good books!	1
i have come to the conclusion that the more  cartoony/funny pages books by chris hart   are best written, clearly explained and   better informed.    this book is great to get a good feel for  the 60's retro hanna barbera/ pink panther  cool mccool [giving away my age!!!] style of cartoons.    the part about creating your on style and  constructing heads/ bodies is good.  the part on showing emotion is well  thought out.    as mentioned before; the other  books that deal w/ manga/mechas, etc  are not that clear in terms of   expalaining content/ process;  but the more humerous books are. one of better of the chris hart books...	2
"kurt vonnegut's ""cat's cradle"" is the story of a man, jonah, who is writing about the ""end of the world,"" or the day when the atom bomb was dropped.  his work on the book encourages him to go on many journeys which ultimately leave him in a somewhat ironic yet very comedic position.  the story features an imaginative religion, a scientific potion, and a far off society as part of vonnegut's many bizarre episodes.  jonah, researches the ""father of the atom bomb"" and his children in order to determine what they were doing on the day the atom bomb was dropped.  seemingly against his will, jonah gets pulled into a plethora of discoveries about the children and their father which he never could have imagined to be true.  his journeys ultimately land him, along with the children, on a secluded island with a radically different society from their own.    i did in fact enjoy reading this book because of the absurdity and the unbelievable voyages which the main character undergoes.  however, it is in fact vonnegut's style that makes the book so enjoyable.  he is able to bring the reader into this world where virtually anything can happen which then leaves the reader totally unaware and clueless as to what comes next.  the world allows him to describe such things as the discovery of the island of san lorenzo in a two page account where six different countries claim and forget about the nation before escaping african slaves finally claims the land for good.  it is through vonnegut's voice and style that the reader may not stop to consider such oddities as this one.    originally, i chose to read this book after finishing vonnegut's ""slaughterhouse five,"" and was absolutely taken away by the combination of absurdity and hilariousness through which he expresses himself in this book.  though i did not expect this book to be as far out as the alien adventure in ""slaughterhouse five,"" it did seem like a pleasant offbeat satire about modern man.  in the end i enjoyed this book more than ""slaughterhouse five"" because of the comedic voice that i found more visible in ""cat's cradle.""  though the first was rather ridiculous and interesting, for me it did nothing more than provoke thoughts about where such an idea would come from, rather than make me laugh.    i would recommend this book to anyone who is seeking an imaginative and far off satirical story that is sure to create a smile.  while many may think the story to be boring and pointless, it is partly this hollowness that makes it so enjoyable.  the reader is baffled and unable to understand why things happen the way they do creating a randomness that i have found to be attractive.  for those readers that were bored by part of the book and decided to put it down forever, i would encourage you to fight through the beginning.  after all, i did in fact at first believe that this would be a serious account of the day the atom bomb was dropped, until the bokonon religion was further explained and glorified. cat's cradle - vonnegut's absurd masterpiece"	2
"""prayers"" is even a better book than the four agreements, though the four agreements build you a foundation.  it is meant to be a book we will read when at the quest of love and peace.  the book is meant to be read when you are angry, sad, experiencing fear and judgment.  of course you still need to find other ways to work on your anger, this book simply have the power to help you let go of those nasty thoughts.  this book is not meant to be used to suppress/deny the existence of anger and fear, for, we need to accept human has all ranges of emotions.  there is no right and wrong for whatever and however we feel things.  at the end of the day, we are just saying prayers to let go of the emotional poisons.  that is the essence of this book.  the words of the book can only be experienced and felt.  you cannot use your judgmental mind to think and to understand nor can you try to rush finishing the book.  some books, for example this one, just are not meant for speed reading because you cannot experience the peace the author wants to give you.  when you open your heart and feel the power of the words, you experience lots of love and compassion to yourself and others.  that is how you want to use this book to open your spiritual eyes and stay there.  this book is easy to understand.  it is meant to be read again and again, especially during turbulent times where we are most easily to slip back to the judgmental self.  i definitely recommend this book to someone who is experiencing some sort of a significant loss in life (whether it is a loved one's death, a lost of job or a loss of marriage).  may we all come out from the turbulent times and experience love and care, which help us return to our authentic self - with love and care and without judgment about self and others. even better than the four agreements!"	1
i asked for this book because i thought it would give advice on how to raise daughters--it does--and more.  dr. northrup begins by explaining how mothers and daughters are connected through the generations, and how we can only create a healthy relationship with our daughter when we heal our relationship with our mother.  as we heal ourselves, we heal all the women who have gone on before us.  this is only a sample of some of the insight she offers into our relationships as women.  i'll admit i was surprised by the holistic approach she takes,  but am glad she offers that insight, as i'm only vaguely familiar with some of the ideas/theories and believe i have more to grow in that area.      rather than a book geared towards raising children (i've read my share--and i thought that's what this book would be) i would categorize this book as a self-help book geared toward strengthening and creating a healthy relationship with your mother and daughter.  very pleased with everything i've read. a new approach to female relationships	1
"this book does start with some slight promise. it has a touching opening chapter. and it follows the life story of one of its villains, who is a very unlikely, over-the-top character, but who nevertheless will probably win your sympathy and may even break your heart. the book also has plenty of cornwell's trademark technical detail. you will be treated to a wide variety of how-to tips on everything from how to fly a helicopter, to what gun to carry for different law enforcement jobs, to how to identify watermarks on paper.     but overall, i found this book to be a big disappointment. first of all, the book is riddled with egomania. almost every chapter contains some lavish adulation of the protagonist, kate scarpetta. almost every character oozes adoration of scarpetta, lives only to win her respect, longs for her, even in planning to kill her seeks only to unite with her in ecstasy. what's all this about? since scarpetta is so clearly cornwell's alterego, a reader can only conclude that cornwell herself is getting lost in a cult of personality.    however, scarpetta doesn't appear much in person in this book. she remains a presence, inspiring others. when she does make a personal appearance though, the book's tone of adoration doesn't mute into any more seemly modesty, as would seem appropriate when an author is in essence describing herself. if anything, the deification of scarpetta intensifies in these scenes. for example, a man observing her, notes how deliberately she does everything. even in the act of reaching for her coffee cup, he sees her ""exuding confidence and power."" really, all this reverence for scarpetta turns these pages into absurdity.    even apart from their hero worship of scarpetta though, many of the other characters in the book are manifestly improbable, or even impossible. a book could perhaps stand one over-the-top villain, such as the bizarrely afflicted one i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review. however, most of the characters in blowfly, evildoers and presumed good guys alike, are leading lives of such mythic proportions, that the book loses all touch with reality. scarpetta's niece, who has been an on-going character in cornwell's books, turns into a full-blown cartoon superheroine here, with preternatural command and capabilities across international borders. one of the actions this niece involves herself with in this book is so outrageous and of such questionable morality, that this subplot would seem more appropriate as back-story for a nintendo game.     there are also specific stylistic problems with the book. cornwell has often used the technique of short chapters, snapshots of sorts, interlacing the actions of the different characters. the technique can be a valid one, building suspense while you are briefly diverted from one character's pending homicide, to the less crucial actions of some subsidiary player. and the technique can be used like a mosaic, to build a picture tile-by-tile. but with blowfly, the chapters have become so short that it seems a mere pandering to readers' presumed short attention spans. i'll admit the tv ad pace of the book kept me going through to the end. snap. snap. snap. now this. now the other. but i'm not proud of my growing addiction to this kind of hit-and-run narration.     then there's the persistent, occasionally jarring use of the present tense - in a context in which this couldn't all possibly be happening in real time. and there are too many ongoing, hackneyed analogies between the brain and various machines. cornwell has always liked these comparisons, but they become constant pebbles in the shoe here. ""no frontal lobe alarm sounds"" rang... ""...her brain can't process""... ""jerking her mind out of gear""...     finally, there is the problem with the book's ending.  it's as if cornwell ran out of paper, or else was ordered by her publisher to simply turn in her manuscript, finished or not. all her knowledge of csi investigative technique count for nothing in the end. none of the plot threads get really integrated into coherence.    so there are a few good things about blowfly. you get to inhabit another serial killer's mind and daily squalid living conditions with creepy intimacy. there are also some interesting psychological insights into the motives of female accomplices or ""enablers"" of such men. there are things to be learned about defense weapons. but these good things get swamped, like the dead bodies that fall into the bayous of baton rouge where much of this book's action takes place. overall, i'd say if you see this blowfly coming your way - get out the flyswatter!. get the swatter!"	2
before embarking on a 2 month trip to italy a friend let me borrow rick steve's guide and said that it was better. i was skeptical but took the book anyway figuring it might come in handy on such a long trip. she was right. rick steve's organizes information in a much clearer and more intuitive way. this comes in handy when you're standing in a busy square, you haven't eaten all day and everything you've tried so far has been a jip and you just want someone to tell you where you can find a good deal. flipping through lonely planet you might think you've been handed a manual on how to overhaul an engine - overloaded with information poorly organized. rick steve's book on the other hand is a breath of fresh air or, to put it more tritely, a helping hand. not to mention that his guides have a personal touch and some of rick steve's own character sewn into them. after some time you really get the sense that he's there with you, helping you along (- now isn't that sweet!). not worth the money.	2
"after reading his last few book with ""co-authors"" i wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the ""co-author"". i have been a fan of mr. patterson since my first alex cross novel almost 10 years ago. while i still enjoy the cross books, i find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. alex-vs- the vampire cult??? kyle craig a serial killer??? alex joins the fbi??? give me a break. i can only hope from the description of cross x the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves. is he even writing anymore????"	2
"i bought this book after seeing another book by raab at a friends house.  i bought a copy for our home so that my then teenagers could have a simple easy to use cookbook .  it has good basic food that appeals to teens and young adults. it tells how to stock a pantry, tools you will need and other helpful hints about keeping your kitchen clean and operating kitchen appliances.  it even has soup recipes, pizza,meatballs,hummus, cookies and many more yummy recipes.  i was going to send this to my son who is away from home for two years serving a church mission but, i couldn't bear to part with it so i sent him his own copy. another great book by raab is ""the clueless vegetarian""  well worth the price!!! a. great starter cookbook and great for snacks"	2

"elmore leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors, and deservingly so.  he has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it.  what many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages, leonard does in a few lines of dialogue.  as such, his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads.  however, 'be cool' is not one of his best.    the concept is interesting enough: a sequel.  and not just that, but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels.  chili palmer returns, trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry.  as always, the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen, cons, and scattered goofballs.  however, when reading 'be cool' i couldn't shake the feeling that the book was rushed.  many of the character (the cop, the gangsta rapper) are scarcely developed at all (the latter, in particular, could have been a rich source of satire).  also, the ending seemed rushed, as well.  leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension.  the reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book.  i'd always recommend elmore leonard as a quick, enjoyable, ""beach"" read.  however, go with something else of his instead of 'be cool. falls flat of its potential"	2
i had never read anything by anna quindlen before so this was my first book.  i will be picking up more of her books as she proves to be a good author.  the story was on an excellent subject although it did jump back and forth quite a bit.  i am married and have never been in a situation like this character but the author easily made you feel the panic, fear and heart wrenching decision making in a way that made you understand the subject matter at hand with a more attentiveness to the real world. sad but thought provoking...good read	2
"this book does nothing but help the author make a quick buck by playing on people's fears.  i *am* a believer in the importance of lowering your bad cholesterol, but i think the way to do it is to talk to your doctor (hopefully you have a good doctor) who can monitor your progress and guide you through the process.  this book has some ""common sense"" information but also a lot if misinformation, such as the stuff on supplements.  none of them has been shown to really work!  don't waste your money.  talk to your doctor first, and be sure to find out if your parents also have high cholesterols and let your doctor know. talk to your doctor instead of wasting $ on this book"	0
i find life among the arapaho as she describes it infinitely fascinating, and wish she would spend more time on that than she does.  she's very good in her description of the setting, also, and i can easily imagine myself on the wyoming reservation.    this is the umpteenth book in the series (10th?) in which a jesuit priest (who is with the st. francis mission) and his friend, an arapaho attorney, solve mysteries on the reservation.  the plot in this series is two-fold (turn of the 20th century and early 21st century) and revolves around an old photograph by curtis on display in the mission's museum.  the photo depicts a staged attack on a phony arapaho village.  in the course of shooting that photo, a woman was killed, so some chapters describe the events around this historic murder, while others describe some present day crimes that appear to be linked to the curtis photographs in some way.  a woman is murdered and her husband is the chief suspect, but on the same night, the newly-hired curator at the museum disappears.  then there's the visit from the senator who may be declaring himself as a candidate for president -- how does that tie in?    coel is an excellent writer, although she makes some blunders that a fact-checker or good editor could help her with.  like all the other states, for example, wyoming has two senators, not a sole representative in washington, and it is highly unlikely that a person who has only been curator for a month would have had time to mount an exhibition, particularly one that involves borrowing materials from another collection.  these things take years, not weeks.      so -- i think perhaps ms. coel is under pressure to keep turning these best-selling books out and that's a pity, because this is quite a good book in other respects.  coel is a great story teller.  i'm also happy to see that the unrequited love theme between the priest and the lawyer is being downplayed. i'm a big margaret coel fan 	2
call me shallow, but, from the cover of this book (a whimsical, illustration with an equally whimsical font), i thought, being unfamiliar with this author, that i was in for an anna maxted/shannon olsen type of read. (sorry if i spelled the last names wrong). i do like reading novels of substance, but i felt that the cover design on this novel completely misrepresented the content. i am disappointed. i am (substance or not) perplexed by the novel's structure and not too interested in the gazillion characters presented (there are too many for my taste!). also, i felt like the fact that nora kept commenting on the fact that there were &quot;too many characters&quot; and &quot;no plot&quot; in the protagonist's stories were just excuses for putting in too many characters and failing to develop a plot. it's probably just all way over my head. i can tell the author is talented, it's just not my speed. cover design misleading...	2
"written in 1948, this engrossing tale of a group of misplaced wartime brits in a poor backwater in west africa touches on so many human qualities that it is a chronicle of our mortality. foremost is the perfectly presented portrait of a marriage that has turned into a lie for both henry scobie, the honest policeman of this coastal town, and his ""literary"" wife, louise, who has become the object of pity and contempt for all the frustrated local british ""club"" members who constantly mind one another's business. scobie no longer loves his wife but can't bring himself to hurting her. he simply pities her. and louise no longer loves henry and wants desperately to escape from west africa, especially when she finds out that her ""ticki"" has been passed up for promotion to commissioner. the atmosphere becomes dark and twisted as a young man, wilson, appears on the scene and, in his youthful stupidity, falls in love with louise while he conducts secret investigations on british authorities suspected of aiding in the smuggling of industrial diamonds through africa to germany. scobie is one of those suspects. a marvelously film noir portrait of a corrupt syrian merchant, yusef, is thrown into the mix. i can see sidney greenstreet doing this part to perfection in a screen adaptation. add jealousy, desperation, a contrast of honesty and lies, sex, and the tortured feelings of a deeply religious man and you have most of what this novel contains. o yes, and then, as always, there's the brilliant writing of graham greene, his wonderful metaphors, crystal clear descriptions, and fantastic insights into the crabbed and self-defeating thought processes of his characters. all this equals a modern classic. my only complaint is a bit of redundancy and pedantry regarding catholicism, a religion i cannot stomach anymore, and my personal disbelief that someone like scobie can take catholicism so seriously. but this is my own thing. greene remains brilliant, original, and indeed, ""the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man's consciousness and anxiety,"" or at least one of the top five. just about perfect"	2
astronomers detect a large object entering the solar system from deep space.  at first it is thought to be just another large rock, but scientists soon discover that it is actually a colossal space ship called rama.  a team of scientists blast off from earth to investigate in a ship called the endeavor.  what follows is a story of exploration, and one of the best conceived hard sci-fi tales ever written.  who built rama?  what is it's purpose?  why did it come to our solar system?  the story follows the progress of the astronauts/scientists in the not too distant future as they methodically explore the unknown space ship.  each new discovery brings new surprises as well.  this is also a political tale as well as factions on the ship and on earth have very different ideas about what rama is, what is represents, and what should be done.    this book is, in my opinion, one of the most intelligent and well thought-out hard sci-fi novels ever written.  first published in 1973, it remains as fresh as if it were written today.  there are several things that i really like about this novel.  first, the exploration of rama by the crew of the endeavor proceeds in an organized and intelligent manner by men and women who are not superhuman. discoveries are assimilated, risks are weighed, and the plan evolves.  one common problem with this sub-genre of sci-fi (particularly when transfered to tv) is that individuals of superhuman stature (e.g. the main character has a ph.d. in astrophysics, was in the special forces, a fighter pilot, and in their spare time a classically trained french chef, a lyric poet, and fluent in ten languages) go off on their own to make brilliant discoveries while narrowly avoiding death.  this may add drama to the plot, but this cheapens the story and moves the entire story from believable to fantastic.  the characters, while perhaps representing some of the best and brightest of humanity, are not absurdly talented beyond reason.  second, rama itself is fascinating.  clarke constructed a rich world for his intrepid adventures to explore.  finally, there is a sense of wonder or awe associated with the exploration of rama that many have tried to duplicate, but none have even come remotely close to succeeding.  this book has `atmosphere'.  early in the novel clarke analogizes the exploration of rama with the opening of tutankhamen's tomb.  there is something wonderful and mysterious about rama that goes far beyond current human understanding, but understandable by humans nonetheless by scientific analysis and reflection.  it is this last aspect that really makes this novel better than 2001.  in the latter novel, the aliens are so advanced that they are utterly incomprehensible.  in rama, the alien technology can be understood by homo sapiens.    if i had any complaint at all, the novel is a bit short by modern standards.  it really seems light at about 240 pages, and it would have been nice if clarke had further developed several of the story lines.  in any case, this is a book that can be read over and over again.  there are very few books that i read a second time, but this has been one of them.  in the end, there are more questions than answers, and many of the questions are not resolved.  i have not read any of the sequels because i heard they are really bad and i don't want to spoil this novel.  this is one of the novels that put clarke into the great three of sci-fi (with heinlein and asimov), and it won both the hugo and the nebula award.  this novel really defines and/or sets the standard for the sci-fi sub-genre of exploration/interstellar archaeology. sets the standard for hard sci-fi	1
this is, without doubt, the most incredible book i have ever read. it may completely change your opinions on foreign policy or may reinforce what you already believe, but it is sure to generate some response and some discussion. sharansky respectfully tells it like it is: when politicians have been wrong, why they've been wrong, and what they should have done differently. his governmental criticism transcends party lines, and even sharansky himself, a jew and a member of numerous israeli cabinets, says that a palestinian state is the only way israel will have peace. this book is everything you'd expect with everything you wouldn't - read it. a must-read	1

even though i'm not selling my house, i got some good tips for making my house look bigger and brighter.  only downside is that some of the pictures are small on the page so it's hard to see the details of what they're talking about in the text.  overall, you get the idea, though. loved this book	2
hope edelman's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study. she has chosen a narrow scope for her research, and that's fine--that is, until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics (such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them. the second hole in edelman's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones--where the basis for this statement? i'll believe it when i see it. it's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships; what's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just don't matter as much. within the context of her thesis, they are not as significant, but this is something that edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she didn't write about them because they are not as significant.  other than these two crucial holes, edelman's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family, both from her own life and from her case studies. it's worth a read, not so much for its actual insights, but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own. weak but worth a look	2
the subtitle of this book, the lives and films of akira kurosawa, is completely deceitful.  there is nothing biographical in this book about either one of its main protagonists.  it is rather a chronicle of the japanese film industry, not without interest in itself.  however, the voluminous facts, tid-bits of information about every minor actor, director, script-writer, and film composer, as well as the synopsis of every film mentioned, makes for increbibly tedious reading.  while the book has its merit as a source of information, not much credit should be given to the author other than for his ability to put together facts that are available from a number of sources.  meanwhile, reading all these capsules of data will leave you dry when it comes to the lives of kurosawa and mifune.  the author tells us nothing about how they lived, felt, thought, behaved,what motivated them; probably because he doesn't know himself.  a simple gathering of public facts, none researched by the author himself because their sources are many and widely available, especially on the internet, do not make for a worthy book. tedious	2
while containing a number of intersting plans for small homes, this book falls short on several accounds.  first, there is almost no text save what is on the inside of the jacket.  that's right: no introduction, no methodology.  there is no explanation of which competitions the plans were taken from or what awards they won. (amusingly, i went to show my neighbor one of the plans that i liked.  he said he liked it too but that it was an old plan from a competition in the early 90's. and would you believe that he happened to have a copy of the competition from which the plan was taken!)      secondly, as to the plans themselves, dimensions are rarely marked and often unclearly.  in the case of two or three of the plans this makes them nearly unintelligable.    the lack of wall sections or descriptions of materials used for the majority of the plans makes it impossible to understand the particulars of what makes the houses energy effecient.    in short, the book far from lives up to its description and isn't worth spending the money for a handful of plans since a person can look at plans all day long for free online. too easy	2
not only did this book have many helpful pointers and much concrete information, it was written in a direct and funny manner.  i'd recommend it, even if i don't know if it will lead to a breakout novel for me (yet!). very helpful	2
i thoroughly enjoyed this book.  if you've read as many mountaineering books as i have, eventually you may read a dozen accounts of the same epic mountaineering tragedy.  even if i'd heard the story before i was enchanted with the burgess viewpoint.  i also encountered some of the tales about the twins' antics in other books.  and i was delighted to hear them tell their own stories.  their respect for the local people and customs was very important to me.   it's a much better world with the burgess twins in it!  thanks for sharing your stories with the rest of us. the bad boys are good!	1
"gives many examples of weapons, most of which are useful.  gives no/few examples of rings/armours/rods/staffs/shields    doesn't really think out a lot of the bonuses, also i question a lot of the penalties one has to take to use a legacy weapon. about the only table worth taking is 4-1, or 4-2. sure its a minus three to your saves, and a minus 2 to your attack power, and a whole slew of hp. the rest of them are so painful they aren't worth taking.     also all the caster ""tables"" the ones your suppost to use if your a caster but losing caster levels and spell slots left and right doesn't make any sense. no matter what feats and wizardry skills its not worth it. those could have been more thought out.    also i question the fact that in some cases the lowest tables, a, d, and g. seem to be a lot better than the b, e and h tables just from the way they interact with things. i do fully agree that the top end capability you can add to your legacy item is quite powerful, the i table is filled with many useful things the you wish you could have picked two of them. what i wish/want was if they're was some way to trade lower level slots to get you the capacity to get two i table skills. also some way to get either more or less slots if you take a less dangerous or more dangerous tables of the legacy grid.    the rules for weapons and fighters/barbarians/paladins/rangers. are very well thought out and are very powerful. yet for anyone other class they need heavy modification to be workable. in a caster heavy campaign like the one i run and participate in its a very low value book. capable but strange"	2
"i have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio cds from the library. i was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. he sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in ""w"" - it drives me mad. he reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.     i am a big fan of audio cds because i can listen to the stories while doing other things - i'm not tied down to the couch. i have listened to many narrators - jim dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. charles frazier may be a ""brilliant"" author, and should stick with writing - period! leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life. boring narrator"	2
to surmise, the book is about an actor who is hired to be a political figure.   i will not reveal any more as to not ruin the nature of the plot.  i felt that like some of heinlein's books, the book is plauged with   politics, less science fiction, the only sci-fi thing about it is that the plot takes place in space, other than that, it's all politics.  same thing with citizen of the galaxy, a book that starts off really well and ending with a theme that do not portray sci-fi rather it shows heinlein's knowledge in law.   i felt that the book could have been much better and i don't see how it won the hugo award.  conclusion: the book is a fun pass, but nothing more. don't expect any groundbreaking plot, or jaw dropping plot twists, just your old fashioned politicians-dear-diary. a good book but like most heinlein's books	2
"reading a poem by baudelaire is like sipping chardonnay on the quayside in paris. formidable! i always return to this book, and i buy as many translations of it as i can. this one i think is the best. as a poet, baudelaire was the master of describing the ""dark regions"" of the human soul. he was the edgar allan poe of poetry. the best poete maudit!"	1

so you pick up this book and read on the back cover the exciting quote about hemingway's ghost and you're ready to drop some cash, right?  guess what--there's zero information about the hemingway haunting in this book!  in addition, old ataulfo of madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic's version of handel's halleluja chorus.  instead, what's offered here is a rehash of old stories (and old theories about what ghosts could be) with insipid, comic book illustrations.  why this is called a &quot;field guide&quot; with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon--be it birds, plants, or mushrooms--is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists.  if you're a serious researcher of this subject, then pass this book up and seek hem's fetch elsewhere. the old feint and switch	2
"the theme is interesting enough - an american inmate of a british lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of oed.  unfortunately the book doesn't have much beyond the outline of the theme.  as some other reviewers have noted, it would have made a decent magazine article, but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition, semi relevant trivia, and melodramatic hyperbole of the ""superior"" victorian english kind. where's the story...?"	0
after completing my first year of law school, i really wonder why so many professors use this textbook.  more than half the people i spoke with in my class thought the casebook's usability was poor or worse.     property is not a difficult class, aside from future estates and related issues (rule against perpetuities).  the hardest thing about property is knowing the jurisdictional views on various aspects of property law, and this casebook does only an ok job highlighting that.  it is basically a lot of memorization and the learning of that material could have been substantially aided by organizing the book differently.    additionally, many of its cases are not sufficiently edited, thereby necessitating that one read through too much irrelevant information to get to the legal issue.  my other case books are much more balanced on this issue.      as a last note, the production quality is lower than what i would expect for its price.  the paper chosen and the fair reproduction of what photos exist in the book contrast strongly with its price.      i suppose this sounds like a laundry list of complaints, but the book compares poorly to my other casebooks, simply stated. popular ... but why?	2
"this book is divided into chapters with different religio-social related themes such as ""god"", ""money"", ""power"", ""love"" etc. for each theme, the author presents a few movies relating to it. it didn't take long to realize that higgins is a liberal christian who seems more concerned with political ideologies than the salvation of souls. the values promoted are christian to a degree but only those that overlap with modern liberalism.     higgins got annoying fast by constantly criticizing the church (which i think he means evangelical christians) though he doesn't name names. and the reason for the criticism is that they don't uphold the 'true message' of christianity which is that even more annoying buzz word 'social justice' and liberal ethics in general. higgins uses the typical method of judging the 'church' for judging other's behaviors as sinful.     the subtitle ""finding spiritual fingerprints in culturally significant films"" itself is somewhat disturbing. the movie industry is the last place we should hope to find much true spirituality. it is overridden with everything contrary to christianity. saying that some of these movies have the fingerprints of god (i know he doesn't actually say that, but its implied) is to overlook the other prevalent messages in these movies that are ungodly to the core. even a small amount of arsenic in a glass of water is deadly. so even though i do watch movies, i am very cautious to see much holiness in them.     for as much as i didn't like the book, it did introduce me to some new movies which i have now watched and enjoyed. how annoying"	2
nelson george's arguments are clear, well-organized, and powerful. while reading, i was forced to look at things differently than i ever had before. the ideological vision of integration is an honorable one, but the simple  fact demonstrated in the death of rhythm &amp; blues is that integration is  forever indebted to black utility for white profit. it is likely that race  relations in this country would be quite different if whites had not  benefited from the talent and ingenuity of black athletes and performers in  such a profitable fashion. this is ground that history teachers rarely, if  ever, tread on. it is quite tragic to know that the unique and powerful  black culture from which basically all popular music is derived, can be so  easily forgotten or ignored. george's position is most intriguing in that  it reminded me that history may belong to the teller, but there are many  stories to be told. i consider myself fortunate to have heard this one. a forgotten past	1

this won a pulitzer for reasons i don't understand.  maybe it's because i'm not sophisticated enough, but after reading gunter grass i'm starting to think literary awards are given out on the basis of how regular and detailed the physical descriptions of male genitalia and its veins are in the book.  this is a leaving las vegas style story about a guy who decides to drink himself to death.  the only problem is he's lived his whole life and settled in to die by a quarter of the way through the book.  this book gives you empathy with the main character not by putting you in his skin through skilled storytelling, but by boring you to the point you yourself know what it's like to want to die.  this book seems mainly to be loved by those who deem it a mark of sophistication to like things most people find offensive.  sex, foul language, crude descriptions - they're all fine as a means to an end but this books parades them for no literary purpose i can detect.  this book has interesting elements, but it's bad. this book is bad	0
"if you're new to the postmodernism question, then this book isn't for you. better to start someplace else. and if you been looking at postmodernism for a while now, you've probably already read other, more extensive works by the authors of this volume, so you don't need to read this book either. so basically, there's no good reason to read this book.    and if you were going to read it, you would have a hard time because of the way its laid out design-wise. being postmodern and all, zondervan tried to design the inside of this book as ""with-it"" as they could. unfortunately, while i enjoy postmodern book covers, when that same style is applied to the insides of a book it can make for some very tedious reading. much of the text is printed as a light shade of gray using an italic font, which, as any graphic designer reading this review will tell you, is a big no-no. it just makes for hard reading.    oh, and future editions of this work should edit out fredica mathewes-green's attemps at humorous commentary throughout horton's piece.    cheers. pass"	2
"after using dr.dyer's aaah meditation cd for a month, i decided that i wanted to learn more this meditation. therefore, i bought the book manifest your destiny.  the book reads like a personal journal about nine insights he has gained from his own search for spiritualism.  there are many things that disturb me about this book.         dr. dyer cites quotes from the bible to substantiate some of his points without citing the book, chapter, or verse.  one of the bible quotes he uses is ""is it not written in your law `i have said, you are gods?'"" (john 10:34)  this is the passage to which jesus referred when he said this to the pharisees who were attempting to charge him with blasphemy: "" god standeth in the congregation of god; he judgeth among the gods. how long will ye judge unjustly, and respect the persons of the wicked? ... i said, ye are gods, and all of you sons of the most high.""  (psalms 82:1,2,6). the unjust judges of israel (i.e., the pharisees) were the subject of these verses.  they were civil magistrates because of their authority and power; and, they represented divine majesty in the government of the twelve tribes of israel.  dr. dyer uses this verse completely out of context.   scripture cannot be broken.         jesus believed in the bible because it is infallible and immutable as are god's other laws.  a true seeker of spiritualism cannot reconfigure god's word for his own purpose.  neither can the true spiritual seeker be ignorant about god's word and actually expect to know god's and come into a relationship with him.  dr. dyer takes a little bit of truth and expands upon it in a somewhat convincing way to fit our desire for an easy road to spiritualism. the fact of the matter is that according to jesus the door to god's kingdom is narrow (luke 13:24).   there are no shortcuts.        lastly, a true spiritual seeker does not strive to become spiritual with the intention of manifesting worldly possessions.  this appears to be a main theme of dr. dyer's book.  those who seek god first gain all they need to be happy in this world as a ""gift"" from him.  we do not need to grasp at anything as long as we trust god and put him first in our lives.  dr. dyer seems to miss the point. misses the point"	2
i usually try to give everything i read a break, but this book was nothing new or exciting. it had a couple of briefly funny spots, but other than that, it was kinda blah. maybe it would've been more exciting had i not read the nanny diaries a couple of years ago. this book did, however, give you insight into why some rich kids are so nuts - because they're nothing more than an accessory for their parents. nanny diaries.....with palm trees	2
"danielle steel has done it once again. written a book that must have taken her all of one day. i was really disappointed after summer in st. tropez, but thought after a break from her books i'd try again. sorry i wasted my time. this book is so repetitive, same phrases are not only repeated chapter after chapter but in the same paragraph. the story line seems to drag on forever. if steel's goal is to ""dumb"" her books down for the masses then she has succeeded. this book is written at about an 11-year-old's level. don't waste your time. blah, blah, blah"	2
first, i hardly ever write reviews...but after this story, i needed to state something.  second, i am not considered a conservative and relatively open minded. third, i always appreciate history and culture...and understand this story was handed down through generations.    however, never reading this story myself and reading it to my three and a half year old for the first time - i had to stop half way through the book after realizing the heart of the story surrounds a monkey killing a baby owl and the jungle searches for the killer while the mother owl grieves.  to complement the story, there is an illustration of the monkey (snarl showing sharp teeth) hitting the baby owl over the head with a branch...not a bedtime story for this family.    it was given as a gift, and will be returned shortly.. wrong content for young children	0
this classic is one that everyone should read and maybe even read every year!!. classic	1
i'm only half way through this book but i think it has some really great information.  my dh and i are planning to adopt but haven't officially started the process yet.  this book is giving us lots of issues to think about.  it provides good examples of positive language for discussing adoption with your child.  the author doesn't shy away from the hard issues like racism or a history of incest.  she does a great job of integrating child/teen development into all issues.  she cites many studies to support her advice.  the writing is rather dry (much like my own) and academic, which is actually useful.  i trust this author because her writing isn't colored by a lot of emotion.  she uses plenty of real-life examples from the experiences of adoptive families.  the book does suffer a little from being broad and trying to address all flavors of adoption (domestic & international, same race and transracial).  i highly reccomend this book to anyone considering adoption as a way to start conversations with your spouse about the hard issues you will face as adoptive parents.  might even be a good idea to share it with extended family. excellent info, dry writing, exceedingly pc	2
this is a philosophy book. there is almost nothing about natural selection and not much more about religion, just plenty of standard philosophy loosely connected to a condemnation of current western culture and its supposed pseudoscience sustenance. midgley uses the term 'evolution' to mean the philosophizing of scientists and science writers. as religion too is human philosophizing it is hardly difficult to make the two converge.    this 'evolution' midgley citicizes as being too human-centred. as there is nothing more human-centred than the social sciences, humanities and religion and this 'evolution' is really philosophy then it is an empty criticism. only the physical sciences look beyond humans but this is unacknowledged.    she is, though, correct in saying that natural selection is not about progress up a ladder nor about a hostile, doom and gloom world. other than this her grasp of biology is suspect eg she asks how genes can be selfish when they die when the cells they are in die!!!!! no wonder the excellent work of people such as dawkins is beyond her grasp if she does not understand the connection between body cells and germ-line cells.    though i generally agree with midgley's concerns about competitive greed and the destruction of our planet i think she is wrong to blame science, pseudoscience or sociobiology and to disconnect people in modern western culture from their ancestors and their cousins in other cultures. she is clearly out of her depth when it comes to biology, at least.    with a statement that evolution is the creation myth of our age plus the eye-catching mistitle of this book midgley is far more guilty of hyperbole and melodrama and potentially far more misguided and damaging than, for example, dawkins when he used the 'as if' selfish gene perspective.    there are a few interesting discussions of works by scientists and philosophers but, especially for the science writers she criticizes, i would very much recommend people read the books themselves and not simply accept midgley's views on them. eye-catching title as a mistitle	2
"as a card-carrying guy, and card-carrying dave barry nut, this book is just plain dynamite. it captures how us guys behave beautifully--no, we don't behave beautifully, but it captures the primitive nature of how we behave before, and sometimes during, marriage. since reading this book, when my wife wants an opinion about almost anything related to her, i say, ""i have no opinion about that--i'm a guy! what do you expect?""  she already knew this, but having the book to go by re-enforces it. great bit about how barry survived hurricane andrew, which scared the daylights out of anybody, like me, anywhere near andrew's path. great bits about exploding vacuums and a group called the ""lawn rangers,"" either of which, if i read them wile drinking coffee, would put my life in peril. a dandy little book. fit to read over and over"	1
"ok, people, here's some advice before you think about buying this book. don't just look at all the 4 and 5 star customer reviews - rank the customer review list from lowest rank first and read all the 1 star reviews as well. that way you can really get a broader sense of what you might be getting yourself into. sure, in both the high reviews and the low reviews there's just basic no-brainer reviews - ""it's great!!"" or ""its sucks!!"" but amongst all the one star reviews i discovered some smart punters whom i should have read before buying the damn book myself. yup, i bought this monstrous piece of rubbish and after going back and reading all the low reviews i realise that some reviewers had duly warned me. this book is terrible. it gives only the scantiest of basics on body language, stereotypical stuff which any schmuck with less than half a brain could write. and the photos - my god! its mr steele with his wife and their friends, posing away in their garish shirts and shorts...these are some of the ugliest photos to be used for ""flirting"" and ""body language"" i've ever ever seen. and in his blurb photo at the front of the book he's standing there shirtless revealing his copiously hairy chest - there's something about seeing the author of a book posing like this that i find highly disturbing. yucko. as others have said, if i could give this book a zero star rating, i would. avoid, everyone, avoid like the plague. i was duped!!!!!"	0
the nomadic museum, a facility constructed onsite in various locales  (now in santa monica, ca) out of boxcars, cartons, and pipes is in itself an artwork and the peripatetic museum houses some wispy photographs by gregory colbert of moments of world observation that in context are strangely moving. the object is to bring the spirit of mankind into a space outside the usual exhibition venues and in doing so it becomes an experience for the people.    the catalogue that accompanies this show is equally impressive in its conception.  no two books are alike in that they are created from handmade italian paper and bound in a  cover made from unique paper from nepal.  the photographs reproduced well in the catalogue languish from being reductions of the oversized images form the exhibition, but the flavor is there.  images of robed children and adults, animals both alone and in tandem with humans, bits and pieces of atmosphere form a journeyman's eye take on a significance that surpasses the original works.    the catalogue for the exhibition is pricey due tot he one of a kind quality of presentation.  but for those who want to forgo the expense, there is also a version of the images (paperback with 48 pages as opposed to the 232 pages of this volume) available through this site.  if you are unable to experience the exhibition (for that is truly what the exhibition is about) then this art book form of the catalogue is a substantive  memento of a unique artistic experience.  grady harp, january 0. the peripatetic mission of global unity	2
"vengeance in death by j.d. robb is the fifth book in this ""in death"" series by this author who is the alter ego of nora roberts. this pseudonym is only used for her futuristic series (don't let that genre fool you - these books are fantastic, even if you don't usually like science fiction type stories!)     it seems that each of the books in this series so far has the murders involving eve dallas' lover/husband, roarke, in some form or another and this one is no different. if you've read these from the first book, naked in death, then you've followed the relationship evolution between the two strong main characters and you've been given a glimpse of each of their pasts. vengeance in death explores, in greater detail, roarke's past and that of his butler, summerset.     a killer is loose and he's killing men with irish links; unfortunately, that irish link is roarke and his past crimes. summerset's daughter, marlena, had been brutally murdered in dublin, ireland many years before and roarke avenged her death by killing the six men responsible. now it seems that someone is killing roarke's informants from the past. it's eve dallas' job as primary homicide detective in the cases to find out who this mad man is and stop him before another victim is found.     sounds like a typical ""who dun it?"" type book right? well with j.d. robb, you can always expect to find a bit more intrigue, romance and humor thrown into the plot. the added character of ian mcnibb (electronic detective division wonder-boy) is a pure stroke of genius. and the undertones of a romantic entanglement between mcnibb and officer delia peabody (dallas' able assistant) leaves the reader wanting more and not being able to wait to read the next book to find out if these two actually do get together.     one of my favorite support characters, mavis, is missing from this book - actually, she makes a very brief appearance, and that leaves a bit of fun out of the story line. but don't worry - the other colorful characters are all there - commander whitney, police chief tibble, summerset, peabody, dr. mira, and of course eve and roarke.     the identity of the killer wasn't predictable this time, and actually had me guessing up to the end of the book. the clues as to his identity were few and far between, but the outcome made sense once everything was in the open.     vengeance in death is more sound writing from j.d. robb and her versions of the future are impressive. i want a turbo car that can go from new york city to new los angeles in three hours just as they have in this book! (with gas prices the way they are now, i'm wondering what kind of gas and gas mileage they're getting in the future!) it will be interesting to see if the world is any closer to these creations in the year 2058 - only 57 more years to go and we'll see! but i'm first in line for one of those autochef inventions that cooks your meal upon voice command - no cooking, no cleaning - ah, paradise!     vengeance in death isn't the best book in the series that i've read, but it is still excellent. first one to fool me!"	2
"this book is awesome because it teaches.  i learned so much about what to look for (and what to avoid) while shopping.  for years i thought i was ""cursed"" with an hourglass figure.    then i found this book and learned that i was trying to dress as if i were built like kate moss.  now, i buy the fashion magazines and look more at the shape of the clothing instead of the look it has on the model.  i went from feeling dumpy and unattractive to sexy.    i have been a bargain hunter for years, and the pocket stylist has helped refined my tactics.  i still buy $30 shoes and $15 pairs of jeans when i come across them, but now i buy the ones that i *know* will work into my wardrobe.  hello, functional closet.  goodbye, ""i have nothing to wear!""    my dislikes about this book?  it's only pocketsized if you carry a large bag, which i do not.  also, the author could be more descriptive.  i have no idea what the difference is between an a-line skirt and a circle skirt, and her book does nothing to educate me on the subtleties between the two. not pocket sized, but very good"	2
"this not-quite-debut novel (fellowes wrote several romance novels in the mid-'70s under the name rebecca greville, including ""poison presented"" and ""court in the terror"") ought to appeal to fans of his 2001 oscar-winning script for the film gosford park. a straightforward satirical comedy of manners set among the upper classes of mid-'90s england and those who aspire to join them, the book is a frothy comic brew which skewers both parties with the kind of pitch-perfect subtle writing that it seems only the british can pull off. the story is quite simple, a pretty woman from an upper middle-class family whose mother has pretentions decides to ensnare a hugely wealthy and dull aristocratic man in order to ""marry up"" into the upper classes which still hold such a mystique and importance in british society. the man's mother, a formidable marchioness aims to prevent this from occurring but fails. the young woman discovers that life at the top isn't as exciting as she anticipated and runs off with an handsome actor to great scandal. will anyone find happiness at the end?    this is all more or less narrated by a semi-aristocratic actor (clearly very much like the author) who is able to move between all worlds due to his upbringing and career. he starts the book as a friend of the young woman and a very passing acquaintance of the young man, and ends up becoming a bridge between worlds and at the latter stages, a kind of discreet go-between. it is his penetrating sardonic insights and the witty formulations thereof which lend what substance there is to this otherwise straightforward love story. much of the novel involves the narrator spelling out the unspoken rules of the game for the reader in deliciously mocking detail. the main flaw in most satire is that it is too broad or unsubtle, but here the narrator's mockery of the artificially preserved world of the aristocracy is all the more effective from its insider position. to be sure, the characters are mostly ""types"" without a whole lot of substance or depth to them (the boorish rich pig, the nasty arriviste, the brisk no-nonsense wife, the ice queen, the social climber, etc.), but that's kind of the point as well. a great deal of the satire is that these upper crust people have no personality, that they are all just filling the roles they've seen before them and imagine will extend after them forever. ultimately, the book is somewhat bittersweet in that the writing is quite amusing, but one can't help but feel slightly sorry for how unhappy so many of the characters are (even if they aren't particularly deeply drawn). on the other hand, it's not too hard to feel like it's a case of them getting their just desserts... mockery from within"	2
"...because i thought white oleandar was brilliant. but this book? not so much. i would not be surprised if paint it black were something fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. it felt much less fully realized. i found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. i generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. the whole book was written in one note, so i, too, agree with the ""flat"" description. i found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. i absolutely savored every word of fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it. i wanted to like this book so badly..."	0
this book is great for students who are thinking of persuing a course in engineering.  ferguson adresses what makes a great engineer, and also states that many schools do not stress the courses they should.  using this  book, students gain insight as to what they should expect from being an  engineer, and what is imporant in the profession.  i definately recommend  this book to those who are about to be college freshman engineers or are  thinking of changing over from liberal arts &amp; sciences to engineering. great book for engineering students	1
"as a new bride, i thought this book was --well--let's say---boring!. no style..no design and these authors are ""lost"" as far as what brides want in the 21st century. if you are young, hip and cool, this book is not for you. if you are old on a 4th marriage, you might like it. also-warning ..these authors have terrible reviews on their baby bargains book. it seems they write all their own great reviews. i think martha stewart weddings is obviously much better and i also think i would not recommend a book from denise and alan field's ever. this book has no style."	0
hazzard is an elegant, intelligent writer, and great fire is one of the finest novels in recent memory, but i was a bit disappointed by evening of the holiday, a slim novel which tells the summer love affair of a british traveler with an italian landowner.  hazzard has great insight into human nature in general and culutral identity as well, and her lyrical descriptions of the italian countryside are lovely.  however, the story here never quite engages; the love affair is doomed from the start, we are assured, and hazzard can't quite keep us enthralled, as she usually does, although, as in all hazzard's work, there are stunning moments of insight and clarity, and one is astounded how easily she can throw off an aphorism. in love in italy	2
"who is her editor?  the main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. we got it. we do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  i felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to ""get"" her own work. it would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit.  not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, i did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. sue miller needs to give readers some credit"	0

this was by far the most informational book i have ever read on conservatism. i learned more about the history both the good and bad about conservatism. also this book is very practicle and worthwhile. no hype just fact and purpose. anybody who is a conservative should read this book so as to know the rich history we have and the future direction we are taking.    to those who are not conservative or dont know if they are conservative please read this book. it is a book that should not be taken lightly. the very history and future direction of conservatism lies within its covers. a must have in every library. it is in mine. the conservative mind: from burke to eliot	1
first of all, i did not go through all examples, but i did read  all the chapters. this book  is truly super in the depth of coverage. once you gained  an advantageous position, how do you plan your attak? how   do you execute it? all is covered.    only gripe:  the chapter on phases of attack should have placed right after the  chapter on different classic mates. great chess strategy book	1

john mcphee rides with a cross-country trucker who hauls chemicals; takes a course in piloting ocean going vessels; navigates the illinois river with a thousand foot string of barges; describes how a million packages a night are sorted and shipped from a ups facility and rides in the cab of a mile long train hauling coal. his descriptions are full, informative and never, ever boring (except once when he describes a canoe trip, but that chapter is easily skipped).      there is a very slight hint of condescension in mcphee's narrative; he is always at pains to remind the reader how little formal education his subjects have. perhaps this is something ingrained from his new yorker writing. fortunately this habit is neither overly intrusive nor obnoxious.      his descriptions of each of his adventures (other than the canoe trip) are wonderfully informative. his sense of awe at ups's massive and incredibly complex sorting facility comes through to the reader along with a marvelously detailed description of how the of miles and miles of conveyors and automated tools acting with very little human intervention move more than a million packages a night.      mcphee made me wish i could join a tow boat captain as he maneuvers a thousand foot line of barges up and down a narrow river. or sit in the cab of a locomotive as it loads up more than a hundred cars with tons of call, a train more than a mile long that can be ascending one side of a grade while descending the other.      overall it's quite a set of adventures and one well worth reading.    jerr. a great tour of modern transport systems	1
not only does swedenborg's heaven &amp; hell provide rational answers to the question, &quot;what is this life and this world all about anyway?&quot; but it also gives us the combination to unlock the door to happiness.  what's more, one of swedenborg's central statements is that everyone may choose to enter into heavenly happiness.        this is incredible!  the choices we make in our daily lives, whether from loving or hateful motives, are an expression of the ultimate choice we will make about what kind of place we wish to dwell for eternity.  the further implications of this idea is that as we form our lives by the choices that we make, we can choose to become more and more &quot;heavenly happy,&quot; right here, right now, if we apply the ideas in swedenborg's book to our lives today.        i found these concepts to be inspirational and informative, a book that could be read over and over, always discovering some new gem of wisdom. heaven in your life - today	1
stan really did keep and care for james and his family, including when james briefly returned to ireland to establish an art cinema chain leaving his family in italy.    excellent insight into the brilliant writer by his also brilliant brother. please read this book for greater understanding and afection for the specifics of joyce's work (how stan was pictured in the story a painful case), although the view of the universal themes grows dim as we can no longer see the woods for the trees    essential to any complete james joyce bookshelf and a wonderful and grateful gift for any member of the fervent joycean faith. excellent insight into the artist	1

i understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible.  this book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. it's quite amazing how by using the right words pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated. ...	2
although the book's jacket cites a lot of flattering comments like &quot;fascinating&quot; and &quot;to our pleasure, amusement ...&quot; - unfortunately this is simply not true. the book is - for the average reader - overly scientific, dry and boring. scientific, unfortunately not amusing	2

"this isn't really a novel and it isn't really a collection of short stories, but the vignettes are more fable than whimsy because fables are filled with lessons.  alan lightman writes about many possibilities of the alternate reality of time, as he imagines einstein envisioned them.  each alternate reality builds off a cliched phrase we use to describe time:  time is money, time flows uphill, live in the present - forget the past, time is motion, etc.     lightman writes beautifully and his imagined realities are intriguing, each could be the setting for powerful stories.  it's a quick read, a fun read, and well worth the 'time.'    - cv ric. a fantastic exercise in ""what if"""	1
the book covered the period of history just at the turn of the 20th century. i found it to be very informative and made me feel like i was right there strolling the streets with ted roosevelt. although the book is  strong in its era coverage more attention should have been given to the  various laws and acts that were in place at the time preventing  &quot;police&quot; to perform their respective functions. magnificent police era history	1

annie proulx has the ability to paint images with words that most artists and photographers can only dream of doing in their media.  this fact alone makes her book an enjoyable read by anyone who reads a lot.  unfortunately, imagery is about all there is to recommend bad dirt: wyoming stories 2.  the narratives tend to drag in many of the stories, in others the author has trouble getting the suspension of belief she seems to be looking for.  all in all, for this reader at least, a major disappointment.  for readers who have enjoyed other works by proulx, i wouldn't recommend reading this one. so near, and yet ...	2

i think susan sontag is missing the political nature of illness.  as far as i'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine.  the victim is blamed because the victim has little power.  the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful, the oil companies are powerful, the sugar companies are powerful, the retail chains are powerful, the manufacturers are powerful, the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful.  they have armies of lawyers to defend them; they have armies of doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest, but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame.  this isn't about language, it's about politics of money and power.  language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill, and victims more generally. this book misses the point	2
"i liked the story line a lot, the only thing i did not like was that the author -repeatedly- had to say what a perfect body the main character had. lol. i mean after the sixth time.. we got it! lol.. definitely a guy and definitely fantasizing when he wrote it i'm guessing..  perfectly toned, perfect everywhere else. good, now move on! :)    other than that, i really liked the description of what the ""bad guy"" mechanisms were. too bad i can't use those kinds of disguises in real life. very interesting :)    i'd still recommend the book :. for the most part, very good :)"	2
"i've seen several not-so-good reviews of this book so i wanted to write a good one.  i'm not finished reading it yet, but i only have about 60 pages left and i've read enough of it to know that i'm thoroughly enjoying it.  there are parts of the book that are laugh-out-loud funny and other parts that are so detailed and insightful that i am enjoying this novel on many levels.    if you like authors whose writing is what i call ""quirky"" (a little on the weird side but i mean that in a good way...interesting and funny details on almost every page), you'll love this book.  i know that my local library has at least three other books by this author and i intend to get every last one of them during my next trip to the library.    the kind of quirky, comical, insightful writing that i like is best represented by the following book, which i actualy bought instead of borrowing it from the library, and i don't buy books very often:    a girl named zippy: growing up small in mooreland indiana by haven kimmel    http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0767915054/ref=pd_sxp_f/104-1969313-5510321?v=glance&s=books    if you liked ""until the real thing comes along"" by elizabeth berg, you will absolutely love ""a girl named zippy"" by haven kimmel. quick, enjoyable read...quirky, comical writing!  :-)"	1
"in a nutshell, the ludicrous scenarios and insinuations in this book are so stupid and insulting to anyone's intelligence that i'm surprised it got published at all. a lawyer wrote this garbage, huh? i wonder where he graduated from. perhaps he obtained his 'degree' from the same place scott peterson got the 3 fake ones hanging on his wall? unbelievable! did this 'author', and i use this term loosely, ever do any real research on this case?    this dalton character who wrote this book obviously just needed a money fix. must be a mediocre-at-best attorney to have to stoop to this level of ethical malfeasance. a total lack of integrity on his part is an issue as well.    for those who care about laci peterson and the truth of her murder read sharon rocha's book, ""for laci"" as well as catherine crier's book, ""a deadly game"". also, do some research on the investigation itself-a lot of information is in the public domain. if i could find information on this case myself, a lowly civilian, then surely dalton could have. i just don't think he wanted to, frankly. i believe i could write a better and more accurate book all on my lonesome!    skip this book unless you truly don't think scott peterson killed his wife and son. 0 stars, actually!"	0

"having travelled all over the usa by automobile, i was disappointed at the paucity of information and the highly selective coverage in this book.  i had hoped to obtain an update, and more comprehensive coverage of all 50 states.  i found it too selective with major ommissions by state (e.g. kentucky has no entries at all) and smaller to mid-size communities such as champaign, illinois, or the beautiful rock river valley of nw illinois are conspicuous by their absence.    most disturbing is this.  i live in the greater houston, tx, area, and read the authors' motel recommendation on us-59.  not only is that motel and immediate area known for being a place of constant drug raids, but also it is a major area of known street prostitution and that motel seems to house them.  i hardly consider that ""family friendly"". disappointing"	0
"mark rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in america.  most of his ideas are solid, but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word ""interesting"" to describe it.  did they actually read it?    this book is an unending parade of boring and repeated ideas presented in different, yet equally boring ways.  i honestly beleive that this book has destroyed the thrill of musical chairs for me forever.  this book could have been written in about 150 pages instead of the 250 it actually took if he simply used his original, not to mention solid, ideas.  the nature of the book greatly weakened his overall argument.      not only was the book dry, but it also seemed to fail to acknowledge the global system the us is a part of, and in particular, the role that immigration plays on poverty in the us.  he talks about the us and the people in it as if they were static, but we live in a very fluid world, growing more fluid everyday, and i feel that his failure to ackowledge this fact truly hurts his overall argument. 5 stars? really?"	2
this is the best book about dogs in general and daxies in particular that i have held in my hands. don't let the title fool you - this is a book that, while written in plain english, will teach you a multitude of things - how to care, train, and bond with your dax from puppyhood to old age. i have already recommended it to any dog owner i know, regardless of their breed, because many of the things inside the book are applicable to all breeds, not just the daxies. i highly recommend that you add this book to your cart, you will not be sorry you did. a superb book - highly recommended	1
turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose, months after i gave up on it. i have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and t-o-c is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. i struggled, oh how i struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. i stirred the pages wildly while i waited for the plot to thicken. i fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. i searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if i had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. i left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. i offered it to my  neighbor so he could jack up his car. i considered lighting the fire with it. i wondered whether, if i took just a few pages a day, i could eat it and get rid of the evidence. i offered it to my mother-in-law for christmas. i took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt. and then, eventually, voila! the rattling door! what a fine tome t-o-c is. another few hundred pages [...] and i could have used it as a sea anchor for the titanic. one unused to dispose of	0
i liked the stories and thought they were entertaining and erotic, but i think they could have gone a little further into true eroticism, and less further into simple vulgarity.it's not often that i like every story in any book with several, but that's just what happened with this book. i really did enjoy each and every story. it contains enough stories that at least several almost undoubtedly will hit with each reader. this book was great fun and never once even tried to convince me, the reader, that it was anything more than a collection of stories designed to excite and titillate. but this one remains my favorite.the book includes some really good writers too. pretty great book	2
after reading this book, i would like to make three points about it:    1.) first of all, don't make this your first dean koontz book.  this is the second book of the so-called christopher snow trilogy.  read the first book in the trilogy first -- fear nothing.  the first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.    2.) second, please be aware that koontz has yet to write the third book in the christopher snow trilogy.  this is a real shame, because seize the night ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title ride the storm.  but since it's been over eight years since koontz has written a snow novel, i wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.      3.) third, i must admit i didn't really care for this book at all, and i say that as a koontz fan.  lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  koontz wastes a lot of space repeating things he originally wrote in fear nothing.   i found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.    the plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  all the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  i was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  it was just too silly for my tastes.    koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  instead of this book, i would therefore recommend watchers, intensity, odd thomas or velocity. three points about this book	2
i learned about debra ponzek from a nick jr. newsletter at my child's daycare center in connecticut.  i tried her cowboy cookies recipe from the article and i was hooked on ponzek.  it's pretty cool that she is a connecticut resident as well.  i love the fact that recipes are kid-friendly with adult appeal.  no smiley faced plates,...just yummy food.  i've only had the cookbook for 3 weeks and have enjoyed the following recipes:  tuna, pasta & celery salad, fresh mayo,spinach salad with dried cherries, almonds, & blue cheese, ham, cheddar & tom quesadillas, arugula and proscuitto pizza, aux delices marinara, rigatoni with ricotta, tomato, and basil, two simple sauces of basil-lemon pesto and sweet tom marmalade which i served with pan-seared tilapia, and vegetable fried rice.  my hands-down fave has been the pizza.  the aux delice sauce is my fave to date & i've made many from the food tv network chefs. addicted to this cookbook	1

in an inventive, imaginative plot, john dunning successfully combines elements from 20th century literary and film history into a tale of deceit and psychological manipulation. each of the players in this intricate plot of murder is lying - but about who, about what? cliff janeway tackles the conundrum in his usual style - intelligent, canny, suspicious, and sometimes over-emotional - and nearly comes to grief himself. what makes him such an appealing kind of guy is his need to act on his principles, regardless of risk. an intriguing backstory, twisty subplot, and surprise ending make sign of the book another page-turner. laura	2
"fascinating look at how architecture and interior design influence our mood and behavior. you gain general priciples and insights into what makes an space inviting or unappealing.  this is a great book for an architect or interior designer with an interest in environmental psychology.  this is not a ""how to"" book for consumers who want remodeling ideas. environmental psychology"	1
"i read this in high school and could certainly relate to holden at the time. he's an angry, rebellious, sarcastic teen with a serious attitude problem. throughout the story, he grows, he learns and he faces some really horrible things in his past. the story is 'badly' written to some standards but in an artistic way which reflects the character. there are a lot of intense situations and some profanity (as a teen i was like ""cool!"" hehe). in the beginning, holden seems to hate te world. you start out hating holden and thinking he is a jerk but through the course of the story you learn so much about him and you share his pain. you learn that benieth a tough mask, lies a smart, sensitive and thoughtful person. it's a flawed story, with a flawed character in a flawed world but it all seems so real that you feel like you are there. it has a lot of dry, sarcasic humor which had me laughing out loud in class. mostly it's a story about growing up and the journey of a young man discovering who he really is in a world full of phony people. i can see why this is a classic! a warning though to those who are sensitive or easily offended: there are some sad parts and lots of foul language but without this it would not be the same story! it's a timeless story and i would certainly read this book again. some love it, some hate it...i love it!"	1
written a little bit too ironically. i did enjoy the reference to encyclopedia brown. fun for a quick read and perhaps for those who are more enmeshed in the nd world than i. not as funny as i hoped	2
well, my wife and i tried this diet plan, and lost a little, but...  con: some of the ingredients and just a marketing ploy.  con: it makes no mention of what to do if you're lactose intolerant.  con: how do you thicken a sauce without cornstarch?  arrowroot?  pretty hard to locate in most grocery stores.  file gumbo? makes a green gloppy mess out of your meal.  con: somewhat poorly written, more poorly compiled into a book, and the person or persons in charge of the index need to be educated (back to school with you now!) in compiling a comprehensive index.  facts and figures are just too hard to find in this book.  pro: she's probably rich from sales of this re-hash of atkins, sugar-busters, and carb addicts.  pro: she's easier on the eyes than atkins was. ...a bit fiddly in my opinion...	0
"steve schirripa's  ""the goomba diet"" does for italian cuisine what ""the da vinci code"" does for catholicism -- the only difference is that once the pope reads schirripa's book, he's going to make steve an official saint.  following in the tradition of his previous literary masterpieces,  (""the goomba's guide to life"" and ""the goomba's guide to love"")   schirripa has accomplished the impossible by  writing a book that's even funnier than his first two.  whether you're italian or jewish, fat or thin, heterosexual or a fanook, ""the goomba diet""  delivers a powerful message from which the world can benefit. and by ""the world"",  i mean overweight italian criminals  indicted under the rico statute who enjoy penne arrabiata.   not only is ""the goomba diet""  superior to any book currrently on the new york times bestseller list, but it proves why  steve schirripa  deserves to host his own late night  network television talk show -- he's far more talented than jimmy kimmel, carson daly, and or that annoying scottish guy on cbs.  and if boring idiots  like ""jerry r. from montreal"" like this book, then it can be enjoyed by everyone. best trilogy since ""lord of the rings"""	1
i bought and devoured will write for food and completely loved it. it's readable, entertaining, informative, and most of all, inspiring. as a food writer for nine years who is continually struggling to build up my career, i found the book to be full of practical, useful ideas and possibilities for exciting new directions for my work. i can't wait to see more from this author. priceless resource	1
this is a great book for anyone in advertising or who is in a lead role or is an entrepeneur.  that is what the author is: the head and founder of a leading advertising company or at least what he used to be until he sold the company.  i find most of the advice to be legit because i've been working in corporate america for a long time and i have come across good and bad managers, but mostly bad ones, unfortunately.  there are some ideas or values that are obviously his personal preference or it may be just talk so he stands out from other people.  i think it is a must-read for anyone in advertising or thinking of starting a business as advertising is a major area if not the most important area that will help drive your business in the right direction.  my only caveat about the book is that it is too long.  this is somewhat not surprising since the author is not a writer and the writing is not as concised and well-written as if written by someone more professional in the craft. good advice overall	2
in this book, the author tries to encourage americans to forget the declaration of independence because even though a plurality of men have rights, the rights of individuals have never been identified.  so, the author becomes a member of marilyn ferguson's aquarian conspiracy and the new age movement, which place individuals above `the people' of the usa and its union.  on p. 277, the author says that the truth or falsities of the natural rights philosophy of the declaration of independence is a meaningless question.    while the author's conclusions can be challenged, his book has been out-dated by advanced knowledge.  first, his writing is out-dated by the 1920 discovery that' all empirical data are symbolic.' thus, one must ask, 'how can the meaning of the declaration of independence become a meaningless when the declaration is formed out of symbols that must be given meaning in order to interpret it correctly?  second, modern science has recently led to the scientific proof of god's existence.  how can man have no natural rights if god exists?    if the author's succeeding generations are accepting this book, the usa is in deep trouble. a way to destroy the declaration of independence	0

heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein's final books.  we are also treated to some of heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  as if this isn't enough, heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  in spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  this novel, as well as most of heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption. another self-indulgent heinlein novel	2
i picked this book up not knowing what it was about, just knowing that it had won the pulitzer.  i have now read it twice; the first time i read it i thought very highly of it, but the second time i read it i not only looked at it as one of the greatest american classics of our time but i looked at it as a fun, early 1900's, college book.  one part of the book i exspecially liked was when martin confesed to both of his girlfriends that he was engaged to both of them at the same time!  i love it!  sinclair lewis was so ahead of his time with that episode!  this is lewis' finest work, a homage to the art of medicine and the spirit of a young man searching for himself and his career.  a must have book. an exciting modern classic	1
written in a compassionate and wise manner intended for those who have experienced a very harrowing situation, this book explores and offers emotionally healthy tools for healing the deepest hurts inflicted by someone very close to us. based on real-life case stories the book explores in a reality-oriented manner the paradox of true forgiveness that allows deep and complete healing for a person. this is not about blaming the victim or sugar-coated attempts at glossing over mud with whip cream ... it is getting to the core hurt and really mending a broken heart so it is stronger and wiser and safer than before. a must read. healthy forgiveness is true forgiveness	1
"i really liked this book. it is a classic book for those who are interested in managing their finances according to biblical principles, and for those who have landed themselves into debt. larry burkett teaches biblical principles of debt-management by telling stories... stories collected over years of counseling thousands of struggling individuals and couples. some of the previous reviewers have said that these stories are just anecdotal scare-tactics, but the intriguing thing is that i see highly-educated people around me making the same ""anecdotal"" mistakes with their finances (and reaping the consequences). americans (in general) have no clue how much house they can afford, etc. and regard debt as a necessary evil... or even as a good thing. this book helps you to see debt in a more balanced light, and is highly recommended to anyone who struggles in this area.    as you can see by some of the other reviews, if you're not a christian, you'll probably get hung up on some of the biblical principles: such things like keeping your word even when it costs you money, family leadership principles, living within your means, and the husband-wife relationship. so if you're not a christian, i would suggest taking a serious look at the bible (by studying what it says) and then compare it to the principles in this book. i think you'll find that the bible is reliable and timeless in its guidelines for finances just as it is for every other area of life. very profitable reading."	1
this book was not at all what i expected.  i have no desire to use burlap as a window treatment.  in additon, the photography is very poor.  the colors are washed out and the windows are just bright white.  i would not have bought this book if i could have seen it before hand.  i do not recommend this book. not very useful and poorly put together	2
"this book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. the writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. there are actually no real descriptions of most of the action. for instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to ""life of pi"" by yann martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). by the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. i came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. it reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary. overrated"	2
"i've read every one of iris johansen's ""suspense"" novels and have loved most of them.  the last couple though have been so painful to get through. this one however, i don't think i can even finish.  i read where someone called these characters ""cardboard,"" and i couldn't agree more.  the female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist.  whereas in the eve duncan books and the wind dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class.  ""now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after.""      i hope that iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time. ugggh"	2
i've read all of iris johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  i found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  what mysterious event happened to jock and royd?  who is macduff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know. disappointing	2
very disappointed!!  i am a very busy mom who tries very hard to cook healthy & low cal for the whole family.  when i buy a cookbook that claims it's quick & easy, i do not expect the recipes to have an average of 15 to 20 ingredients in them.  i don't know what this author considers quick, but i sure don't think there is anything quick about these recipes!  no pictures either. quick & easy???	0
"macbeth v.v 25-30:  ""a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""     stream-of-conscieness technique (no punctuation), southern accents (no spell check), mixed and matched timecrawls (flashbacks without warning), sequencing narrators (voice change with no scene break), first and third person viewpoints (confused yet?), and slapped-your-faceee! symbolism.    for literature, i choose hemingway (who can be subtle or direct, but is always clear).  good books should be enjoyable and understandable.  i understand the story faulkner was trying to tell about a jerry-springeresque southern family, but i didn't like the novel.  if you want to enjoy dsyfunctional american families with blistering social commentary watch 'south park'-- much funnier.  i'll let one of faulkner's contemporaries speak:    ""poor faulkner. does he really think big emotions come from big words? he thinks i don't know the ten-dollar words. i know them all right. but there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones i use.""  --ernest hemingway    unless you are forced into this book for a literature class, don't buy it and don't read it.  if you look hard enough, anything can become meaninful, even this tripe.  victor hugo, shakespeare, and those ancient greeks are excellent in that their works have themes and meanings already.  you don't have to overanalyze and create meaning where none exists in order to enjoy those works.      faulkner is babble and murky and opaque with circular symbolism fading into tempestous violence only an idiot pretending genius or an eleemosynary prententious genius enjoying idiocy might love and obtuse run-on sentences longer than this one are exactly what you'll find all over this classical work. signifying nothing"	0

book #13 in the in death series.  in this book there is a serial killer on the loose and he is murdering people connected to roarke.  eve is in a race to figure out who hired this hitman and whats the connection with roarke.   there is also a visit from an old irish friend of roarkes who was thought to be dead.  there is also some development in the mcnab/peabody relationship.  while there are some tears shed, eve is forced to take a timeout to be a good friend to peabody.  i love these books and as each one is so different, the quality is still excellent. better and better	1

the black jacobins is a timeless classic in both the  history and practice of liberation theory.i enjoyed the distinct pleasure  of taking undergraduate work with clr james in the early eighties. his undimmed  passion and clarity shaped me deeply. he was quite arguably the greatest  unabashed dialectical materialist of the harlem renaissance. i heartily  recommend that you treat yourself to this,his signature creation. a timeless classic	1

stephen ambrose's book tells the story of d company, 6th para. and the taking of the bridges over the orne canal and river.  it is an excellent, if skimpy, telling of one of the facinating stories of wwii.  i have always found the incident interesting since seeing it portrayed in &quot;the longest day&quot;  it is a quick read, and i'd have liked more detail, but it is a good book none the less. a good story, told	2
"i read a is for alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  years later i read s is for silence and was hooked. i started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  i have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven ms. grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6"" frame).  however, i agree with the other readers who feel like this is not grafton at her best.  you just can't believe that kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  the dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  but even with these issues, i did finish the book.  grafton at her low point is still a good read. weak link in a great series"	2
i bought this cookbook expecting it to have a few fun, easy recipes for wraps that i could toss together with stuff i had around the kitchen.  although the recipes and certainly the pictures look delicious, fun and easy they're not.  it's not uncommon for recipes to have over a dozen  ingredients.  when i want to toss together a little lunch, i don't have  time to track down 1/4 cup chopped pickled ginger or 2 cups cooked jasmine  rice or 1/4 teaspoon orange oil.  i have yet to make a single recipe from  this book, despite having owned it for over nine months. eh, whatever.	2

"one of the major reasons why radical feminism remains such a destructive influence on the lives of americans is that it claims to speak for women when it really only represents a minute percentage of them. the feminista activist has proved quite adept at obscuring this fact by labeling their critics as ""patriarchal, anti-woman"" and ""sexist."" the irony lost on many is that no social movement in history has so thoroughly undermined the constituency they pretended to represent.    as always, the opinions of males are discounted, and whatever words men write are deemed compromised, so let us be grateful that carrie lukas came along. she is an equity feminist in the mold of christina hoff sommers and daphne patai, and what many readers already know is that equity feminist is to gender or radical feminist what the green berets are to terrorists. lukas's new book is an insightful answer to the pervasive lies so often told about men. her main theme is that differences between the sexes exist, and there's no reason to label them as good or evil. viva la difference should be the order of every day. by the end, you'll be pleased that she took the time to pen such an eloquent refutation of the alleged, and fictional, patriarchy.     lukas rationally cuts through the lies and distortions which so poison our ether. you'll find skillful refutations to canards like men being the primary cause of domestic violence, that divorce is beneficial to women, and that being born with a particular kind of genitalia enables one to ""have it all."" the real problem with gender feminists is that their need to dominate and control others is far more important to them than their supposed goal of bettering the lives of women. behind their hysterical passion hides a collective of dominatrixes. the only thing that their politics uniformly promote is an increase in their own status and increased feelings of self-righteousness.     on aggregate, lukas's narrative voice is outstanding as she is the possessor of an analytical and dispassionate mind. in my opinion, she even provides a more balanced assessment of radical positions than they actually deserve. the only negative thing i can say about this book is that i suspect few women will read it. my guess is that this is due to its not being feel good or warm-fuzzy enough for them. what those who habitually avoid the non-comforting forget is that knowing the truth is an end in itself, and that a hard chair made of wood is still more soothing than one made wholly from imagination. the feminist war on women."	1
this book is trash written by a man with no faculty for research and no clear understanding of the subject. first define eccentric people as unconventional  types who are healthy, happy and functional (unhappy, nonfunctional types are after all neurotic- not eccentric).  then make the astounding discovery that eccentrics are happier,healthier and more functional than the average.  if this sounds like science to you then you might enjoy the book.    the author fails to distinguish between eccentrics who  don't care about conformity , and those unfortunates who are grossly deluded or constitutionally incapable of conformity.  the author fails to recognise cold-blooded social sarcasm as oppposed to eccentricity.    as an experienced eccentric i  found the book  poorly thought out, self contradictory, and somewhat patronizing. with friends like these...	0
i gave this book to 45 participants in an innovative leadership training class as a pre-reading exercise.  they gave it back to me because of the following reasons: the layout is difficult to follow, you need a glossary  to keep up with the acronyms. and what exactly is the point here. not for everyone	0
"title begins:  ""the party of death: the democrats...""     just tonight - august 14, 2006 - while being interviewed about this book on the colbert report, ponnuru *clarified* that what he calls ""the party of death"" is really a collective of all who are pro abortion, regardless of political party! ponnuru explained that he knows it's not all democrats that are pro abortion, and he openly admitted there are republicans who are pro abortion!  so colbert asked ponnuru if he had also included the word ""republican"" on the book's cover (to be fair) to show that some republicans are in ponnuru's collective ""party of death"", and ponnuru said no, he did not include the word ""republican"" on his book's cover, and colbert then asked that maybe ponnuru didn't have enough ink to print the word ""republican"" on the cover, or maybe ponnuru didn't think he had enough room on the cover to include the word ""republicans"" along with ""democrats"" for the reader to understand his collective ""party of death,"" which again, according to ponnuru on national tv, is a group category that includes all who are pro abortion, not just democrats.     yet the inside flap of this book asks, is the democratic party the ""party of death""?     does ponnuru even know what he's talking about when he's this mixed up, completely contradicting his book's cover and inside flap on national tv?. ponnuru is all mixed up, right from his book's title!"	0
"michael connelly used to be a crime journalist. that's why i think this mystery, which has a journalist as the main character (a guy named jack mcevoy) works so very well, with every scene jumping off the page and certain scenes making the hairs on the back of my neck stand up!        now about the plot...mcevoy's brother, a cop, is dead and the death is declared a suicide. but mcevoy doesn't buy it, knowing his brother as well as he does. of course, others think he is simply in ""denial"" but as mcevoy digs deeper, suspicious patterns start to emerge, linking cop ""suicides"" with a network of pedophiles and, in particular, one pedophile, nicknamed ""the poet"" for his use of lines of poe poems, lines which he leaves at the scenes of his crimes.       every chapter, every page, seems realistic, believable. i was immediately riveted and even though i did sense the killer before the final pages, it took nothing away from reading a book so well-crafted with such fine detais. connelly made me feel like i was walking around in mcevoy's shoes, looking through his eyes.       so there you have it - a bare plot outline and an opinion about a very fine writer. i do suggest you start with this book, as connelly's quality can go up and down from book to book - or perhaps some of his works simply resonate with me more than others. this book is a top notch mystery. my favorite connelly book because he starts with what he knows, journalism"	1
"i sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and i want my week back. it only took that long because i had to push myself to finish it.    spoilers ahead: meggie and father ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as ralph de bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and meggie is...ten. she speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. as the years go by, father ralph de bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. as meggie is also ""developing a very feminine figure,"" ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. they discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand ""don't love me, my darling, for i love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be"" conversations throughout the book. finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. in a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. and wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. ralph de bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's ""stolen"" something back from god. but wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy i've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. so she sends him to father ralph de bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that it never once occurs to him that this might be his child!!!!!!! apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. the big secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.    all this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes meggie sound perpetually ten years old (""i'll tell you something else about your roses, ralph de bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!""), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious ""tragic"" scenes i've ever read (death by pig). yet the ralph-and-meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. and we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. i was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter justine as a ""monster"" and a ""b* tch,"" for example, seemed to have no basis. the last third or so involves meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. the quick ""the end"" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if i'd still cared by that point. even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. scarlett o'hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. warning: this novel may be dangerous to diabetics"	2
from what i can tell by the reviews on this page, all the proposals in this book are basically libertarian. it is thus highly misleading that the book calls itself centrist. the fact that only one person on this page has realized this, yet seems to think it's a good thing, is also rather disturbing.    the book seems like a thinly veiled attempt to move political dialogue rightward by making radical neoconservative proposals--many of which the bush administration clearly supports--seem moderate.    let's call a spade a spade. seems pretty right wing to me	0
"the rampant lunacy and blatant buffoonery in this book is such that it should not be read in one sitting.      genesis 1:1-2:3  the genesis 1 creation account conflicts with the order of events that are known to science. in genesis, the earth is created before light and stars, birds and whales before reptiles and insects, and flowering plants before any animals. the true order of events was just the opposite.   god creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day. yet he didn't make the light producing objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth day (gen 1:14-19).  and how could there be ""the evening and the morning"" on the first day if there was no sun to mark them? gen 1:3-5  in genesis 1 the entire creation takes 6 days, but the universe is at least 12 billion years old, with new stars constantly being formed. 1:31.... let's not fall for ""one day in genesis is not 24hrs but rather a really long period of time"" ......its is stated that ""evening and the morning was the first day!!!!! hence, 1 day = 24hrs.   besides, plants were created before light, if one day was a long period of time the plants would have died before god got around to creating light.     god curses the serpent. from now on the serpent will crawl on his belly and eat dust. one wonders how he got around before -- by hopping on his tail, perhaps? but snakes don't eat dust, do they? 3:14  ""there were giants in the earth in those days."" well, i suppose it's good to know that. but why is there no archaeological evidence for the existence of these giants? 6:4    the flood  gen 7:20  the flood covered the highest mountain tops (mount everest?) with fifteen cubits to spare.....good grief!!!! every eighth-grader knows that mount everest is so high that it has its own weather at its summit.  it could be sunny and calm in the valley but on its peak a swirling snow blizzard.  the atmosphere at the top is so thin it's unbeatable.  yet good ol' noah and a boat fill with two of every ""kind"" of animals bobbing around, floating free with now problems.  i get it!!!! noah and the gang had individual breathing apparatus for the thin air and sub-zero thermal protection for could.  or ....mt. everest was just a mole hill way back then..... oh please!!!!!!!    the flood story was adapted by the hebrews from an earlier babylonian myth called the epic of gilgamesh which is a lot older than the biblical tale and virtually identical.    gerald spilled much ink trying to harmonize scientific facts with the genesis mythology that i cant help wondering who on earth he would reconcile other biblical nonsense such as:     james 5:7 by praying, elias was able to keep it from raining for three and a half years.   act 5: 15-16 the sick were healed just by touching the shadow of peter.  luke 9 39 epilepsy is caused by devils.   2 kings 13:21 a dead body is brought to life when it accidentally touches the bones of elisha.      be afraid, be very afraid.  this is the sort of trash proposed by creationists for inclusion in our high school science curriculum. ......what planet do we live on again???????. support science not superstition !!!!!"	0

"this is a fine example of a respected intellectual lining up in defense of a difficult-to-justify war and coming out quite convincing.    of course, to come out quite convincing, hanson has to resort to some classic and tired old tricks like attacking the protesters of the (then-upcoming gulf war ii), questioning the patriotism of people who dare to question authority, questioning europe (they can't possibly understand us, he writes, even though we basically came from them), and other howlers.      there are some points here, and some moments where hanson shows that he may be approaching sense.  this is an educated, intelligent man.  he has notable insights into immigration, and multi-cultural societies, with california (or mexifornia) as an example of multi-cultural change.  he's very well rounded, and he's not an outright conservative pundit or intellectual.      but too often, i found him repeating what i hear on cable tv, the same old lines, the same old tired arguments about the war on terror.  he loves the anti-american argument.  he thinks people 'don't get it', when they complain about the usa but meanwhile want to act and be like americans.  there are some points to be made here, but too often i found hanson comfortably settling into the easy chair to wax on about american greatness and international cluelessness.     i like how he throws out lines like ""second, the europeans also don't have a clue about america's world role--past, present, or future.""  huh?  i take this to mean that they a) actually don't know any history, or b) don't 'get' our role in history from the american point of view, meaning unconditional support for the world's superpower.  it's funny, of course, considering we as a culture filtered down from europe.   he settles into a veiled 'love it or leave it' attitude, with the classic, 'why do so many people flock to america?'  i don't think they flock here because they don't like our policy in iraq, i think they value the freedoms and opportunity available here.  hanson is either clueless, as is a president who can ask with a straight face, 'why do they hate us?' or he simply knows the answer but...     it's funny, and sad, really, that hanson, and millions of others still don't seem to 'get it'--namely, that there may actually be a separation between the people, the culture, and values of a country (america) and then the actions of the government abroad and at home.  i guess you can never get enough mileage out of pointing at people and saying 'anti-american'.      by the time you finish the book, if you can, you might wonder whether hanson himself believes what he's writing, or if he's an outright cynic.  i guess it doesn't really matter in the end, since if he's a good enough writer, then the effect will be the same.  you may agree with much of what he writes, but on the war on terror, on bush's pipe dream of bringing democracy to the middle east, well, he's either buying it (with a wink and nudge), or he's honestly hopeful. true colours"	2

"anyone who wants to grow and improve can benefit from reading john eliot's book, which teaches you how to develop the power of focused thinking and, thus, to develop yourself in whatever you do. eliot explains how to use focus to become an exceptional thinker and performer so you can achieve extraordinary things. he believes in following your passion, learning to live in the moment and incorporating some fun into your life and your job. these concepts can help anyone perform better, but they particularly call to those who want to transcend being ""average"" and to live with passion and purpose. eliot explains that the human body is physiologically designed to perform exceptionally well under stress. therefore, he says, don't focus on eliminating stress from your life. instead, make good use of it. although eliot uses numerous examples from sports to illustrate his fundamental principles, readers without a great interest in athletics will still find his stories very interesting, applicable and helpful. even if this sensible self-help book contradicts some popular self-perfecting advice, it provides a strategy for putting your passions and mental powers to work. we recommend it to those who lead stressful lives - here's how to make stress work for you. packed with knowledge!"	1

"cortazar was one of the more unearthly literary geniuses of the 20th century; like borges and nabokov i return to his short stories often (more than a decade after first discovering them), and can still get new things out of them.    i agree with previous reviewers - cortazar's precision with language rivals nabokov, kafka, proust or borges.  i would add another comparison as well - though the intent is quite different, the very musical and rhythmic sensuality of the writing also recalls the best of ferlinghetti - cortazar is confident enough in his expertise to be willing to play with language in a similar fashion, and creates extraordinary and unforgettable worlds throught this (and other) collections.    this is a great introduction to cortazar, with many personal favorites: ""night face up,"" ""idol of the cyclades,"" ""house taken over"" and ""axolotl"" are all unforgettable short fictions.  i wouldn't stop there - cortazar's other writing is well worth investigating (especially the second story collection, all fires the fire).  cortazar seems to be sliding into unfortunate obscurity as of late, with a number of key works currently out of print.  thankfully, and for the time being, this is not one of them.    -david alsto. a fantastic intro to cortazar"	1

"this is the third installment in the mitch rapp series and the author's fourth book overall. (i'd suggest reading the previous books both for chronology reasons and that they're better reads.) mitch is america's #1 ""go to"" guy when it comes to fighting terrorism. in ""separation of power"" he is faced with cleaning up some open issues from his last mission (someone tried to kill him), the political ""in-fighting"" surrounding the naming of a new cia chief, rogue mossad agents, iraq gaining nuclear weapons and falling in love. one could be forgiven in thinking this last issue would make for a pleasant diversion while our hero prevents ww iii. not so. mitch's romance takes a front and center position and in a word is well ... comedic. the ""action"" threads of the plot - which this author has worked so well in his previous books - is hinted at in the first 100 pages, doesn't really begin until after 200 pages - and then proceeds in fits and starts. there is an inordinate amount of ""character development"" - self-serving, amoral, scheming politicans & our world weary, battle scarred reluctant hero mitch, who must once again pick up the sword to do what no other man can do - which like the ""romance"" impedes the plot. the book hastily concludes, (20+ pages), in an unsatisfying and simplistic finale. hopefully this book is an anomaly in the series because the author's previous books were great roller coaster rides and provided entertaining reading at the beach and in airports. unfortunately the much rushed conclusion and mitch's ""new"" situation doesn't guarantee that. series hits a brick wall"	2

i was exposed to this book in what i think is the most unfortunate way possible, it was read to my child in her public school kindergarten class. i was stunned and emotional when she came home and told me her teacher told her that a candy cane was a j for jesus, and that the red stripes were his blood, and if she loved jesus the white would wash it away. my child is five years old, and was disturbed by the whole thing.  this book has no part of the christmas story in it, and the tasteless metaphor of it is impossible for a young child to understand.  the illustration is graphic and also not age appropriate.  the only good that has come from this absurd destruction of an innocent holiday treat is that now i am even more communicative and vigilant about my child's education and exposure, even in the school i trust with my child's life and well-being. shocked and disgusted	0
it looks pretty, and has shiny pictures, but if you want to learn something new about no limit holdem, this is not the book for you.  this book is filled with barry's opinion on appropriate ettiquette at a game, money management (nothing specific, just him saying don't blow it - seriously) and is basically his autobiography.  i play online professionally for a living (small stakes) but am developing into a pro.  i would recommend the theory of poker - david sklansky.  tournament poker for advanced players - david sklansky.  and of course super system - 1 or 2 is the same for the nl holdem section.  i mean no book is going to turn you into a pro, it takes a combination of things, and alot alot of play.  this book will not make you a better poker player, simple as that. the ak of poker books	2

"daniel b. clendenin's eastern orthodoxy christian: a western perspective seeks to introduce the history and theology of this little-known branch of christianity to protestants. an evangelical protestant, clendenin became acquainted with eastern orthodoxy while teaching at moscow state university. he is convinced that protestants and orthodox have much to learn from each other, and that protestants should approach the east with a ""hermeneutic of love"".    the work is divided into seven sections. the first is a general introduction and the second a brief history. the next four sections each deal with an aspect of orthodox theology unfamiliar or confusing to protestants. these are the emphasis on apophatic revelation, the use of icons, the relationship of scripture and tradition, and theosis. in the final section clendenin critiques orthodoxy from his protestant perspective--dealing frankly with the frequency of nationalism and even racism in orthodox churches--but nonetheless trying to appreciate its many fine qualities. clendenin does not have the space to go into much depth on any of these topics, however.    i was not too impressed by the book. much of the work is repetitive, and in a volume of only 180 pages such repetition makes the work very insubstantial indeed. clendenin also makes several errors which caused me to doubt his familiarity with the history of the church. he writes, for example, that the slavs were converted in 988, when this marked only the conversion of kyiv rus and most slavs were already evangelised over a century earlier. his focus is entirely on the church in russia and greece/byzantium and the contributions of other regions are ignored. the work is written in a journalistic style with frequent resorts to quotations and a great deal of footnotes, suggesting that the author is not terribly specialised in the subject at hand.    for westerners curious about orthodoxy, i think there is no better introduction than kallistos ware's the orthodox church, an instant classic when it was first published over forty years ago, and available in a relatively new updated edition. clendenin's work is admirable for its attempt to build dialogue between protestants and orthodox, but his work is really too short. means well, but short, repetitive, and unsubstantial"	2
"i already knew that michael savage was a draft dodger since i always check the new hampshire chickenhawk database. from some reason they do not have his birthday. according to the official ""name authority"" from the library of congress database, his real name is michael a. weiner and he was born march 31, 1942. but why is he a hypocrit regarding american soldiers like me?    dr. weiner/savage does the usual butter-me-up, like on page 104. he talks about former hollywood actors who served in wwii, ""true american heroes yes...they, unlike the empty suits of today, fought shoulder-to-shoulder alongside america's finest young boys. the farmers, the steelworkers, the taxi drivers. the people who made this country great."" the only problem here is that he is describing my family and not his.    his image of former soldiers is extremely negative and very offensive to me. in describing a veteran expressing his true feelings about war ""war is awful..he never wanted to fight, he didn't believe in fighting although he wore the uniform [what do you mean weiner?] and yes he was a hero and has many medals even though he naver actually fought."" this isn't even the pot calling the kettle black. ""their anti-war comments both undermine our troops' morale and encourage our enemies by creating a picture of a divided front."" weiner also states, ""[t]he ill-informed comments of these camera-craving, ex-military types in the attempt to prop-up a sagging self-esteem, do extensive damage to the war on terror and our military."" keep that second comment in mind, but who is the guy with the self-esteem problem? he doesn't have any ""fake"" medals so who is he to criticize a person who actually served?    if anybody is harming our troops it is weiner/savage. on page 88 he actually tells us it is okay for al-qaida to kill our soldiers. really. ""if you were a leader or an intellectual in the muslim world and you saw the debauchery promulgated by the west...and saw your young people gravitating toward the filth pumped over your airwaves, what would you do? frankly you would support al-qaida or any organization [like al-qaida in iraq or the taliban in afghanistan?] that would want to stop that flood of pollution from entering your country."" thanks for clearing up why it is okay for these guys to kill our soldiers. and here i thought they just hated our freedoms.     there are other problems with this book. on page 108 he decries the ""intense use of drugs."" yeah, like limbaugh's abuse of oxycontin that he forgot to mention. most diturbing to me is his use of words such as ""sheeple,"" which is word coined by racist aryan nations members. why he would use a favorite word of anti-semites, seeing as how weiner/savage is a jew, as well as a word used extensively by timothy mcvey is quite strange. he also uses dismissive language like ""leg-crossers,"" (page 85)which i assume is a substitute for ""bitch."" and, finally, for all of you steelworkers, taxi drivers, etc., who are his fans: this guy thinks you're dumb. all you need to do is read page 106 to see what he thinks about opinions of non-college graduates.    as one last snipe on this guy, i just love that photo of him (all photos are of him) in the book, under the line ""my ship has come in."" that is one big yacht he is at the helm of. to his question of where to steer his yacht, how about towards the gulf and to join the fight? i did ny combat, now you do yours. this hypocrit actually hates the military"	0
the book is written about an empire in the future.  i'm not really sure why asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic.  i know this is nit-picking, but i didn't like this book.      apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics.  anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as i do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.    this book is intellectual worship, which is something i can't stand.  intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them.  this idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude.  this smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable.  another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.    if this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization.  surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.    and asimov is a mediocre writer.  the story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed.  i read this book because as a sci-fi fan, i felt obligated. read because it considered a classic	2
heinlein is a great author.  when he sits back and tells a story, he's one of the best.  glory road and citizen of the galaxy are wonderful, and the moon is a harsh mistress should be on the shelf of any science fiction fan.    this, however, is an awful book.  it's not merely one of heinlein's worst.  it's one of the worst books i've ever had the misfortune to read.    the problem isn't that there's no action, although there isn't.  the problem is that there isn't anything of substance to replace it.  there's lots of sex, but not in enough detail to be titilating.  there isn't a love story either; you can't have romance or sexual tension when your characters will sleep with anyone and everyone for any reason.  the book just rambles aimlessly until it ends.    maybe heinlein was trying for an examination of gender roles and sexual identity, but if so he failed miserably.  the characters in this book aren't just from a different culture; they aren't people at all.  they're too flat.  if you want to think about such things, ponder them on your own or read a different book.  i suggest left hand of darkness by ursula le guin.    i will fear no evil reads like an old man's rambling personal fantasies.  someone must like it, but i can't recommend it even to the most devoted heinlein fans.  if you're tempted, do yourself a favor and re-read stranger in a strange land instead. ramblings of a dirty old man.	0
the book has nice full colour pictures of games, and touches the surface of moddeling in 3ds max, but does't work out real examples of modeling. examples of cubes and primitives are all that are supplied, no professional quality buildings or scenes as the cover suggests. not  money well spend. recomended book from quake arena modeler paul steed is modeling a character  in 3ds ma. nice pictures but no real projects	0
i was really disappointed especially because i had read so many positive reviews of the book. it very boring and the only exercises there actually were was one little chapter. the book was more of an autobigraphy of the author as well as about the history of the acceptance of women's masturbation which i could have read online if i wanted to. i wouldn't consider this a self-help book at all. very disappointed	0
this is a beautiful book addressing complex and dynamic elements of parenting. the writing is sweet, dramatic, sensual and educated. it dares to be politically incorrect and encourages a return to intimate mothering that has been lost via feminism and day care. as a new mom, i was overwhelmed with feelings of intimacy for my baby son...i had no idea. i read the chapters, underlined, and tearfully re-read the moving paragraphs to my husband when he got home at night. oxenhandler succinctly captures the power of a child's love for his momma, the smiles that light up a parent's heart, as well as the darker side of sensuality between parent and child. it is a well-researched, albeit brave and scary, text. dare, if you will, to read...	1
"while easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a harlequin romance cover, i wouldn't know the difference.    i'm extremely surprised this is a ""best seller"". maybe i should take up writing because i can't possibly be worse than this.    ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. i read it completely in 2 days, and i'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. i wasn't intrigued, i wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear. harlequin presents...nicholas sparks"	2
the forensic files of batman is about an equal mix of good and bad. when the book is telling a story where batman uses forensic science it is amazing. when the book just spins its wheels about forensics it feels like moench has just been cutting and pasting out of a text book.    the book is organized as different journals written by batman, a young bruce wayne, alfred and jim gordon. the batman stories are well written with a great balance of science and story. not only are these stories great, but the final story of the book is also one of the best batman stories ever told. the young bruce wayne stories are the most informative, but all they do is educate with no story. they are just lists or long winded passages about forensics. they also have a childish tone that matches bruce's age, but not of the overall book. the alfred and gordon chapters are great. each of them allows the reader to watch batman work without being in his head and make very interesting additions.     overall, when this book is doing what it should it is great. it allows batman to fight crime with just his brain and really shows that he has earned the title detective. great book when it isn't a text book	2
i wasted time reading this book that i will never get back.  it was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out.  i only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way i thought it would.  buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes.  but, i would not waste the time if i were you. waste of time	0

"this book is absolutely the best place to start if you want to learn about medieval castles.  it explains in very accessable prose how medieval castles came to be, how they evolved, the roles they served in medieval society, what they were like at their zenith, how military strategy through the middle ages centered around the castle, and how their relevance declined with the changes in technology and the political scene that came with the late medieval period.  the gieses give the reader a very clear picture of what life was like for the people whose lives centered in or around the castle, from the nobility at the top down through the staff needed to keep the castle running to the villagers at the bottom. in particular, it shows the various functions that the castle staff needed to serve in order to keep things running smoothly, and the duties of those responsible for those functions, from chamberlains, chaplains, seneschals and stewards down to pantlers, haywards and reeves.  in many cases, the best things are the historical anecdotes used to show a particular aspect of castle life, from the manner in which meals were served to the ways provisions were acquired in an era where money was by no means a common exchange, and how matters of jurisdiction often overlapped in problematic ways (a lord might have jurisdiction over a castle but not over the forest surrounding it which belonged to the king).  this is not what i would call the definitive text on all aspects of castle lore, but it is probably the single best place to start to get a clear and detailed education on, as the title indicates, ""life in a medieval castle."". the best place to start to learn about castle life"	1

"what can i say about ernie pyle?  one of the most well-known correspondents in wwii, he wrote with an empathy for the common infantryman that transcended his simple, eloquent prose.  ""brave men"" is a collection of the articles he wrote while covering the war in sicily, italy, england, and france.  exceedingly modest, pyle always downplayed his role while extolling the infantry fighting on the front lines, his beloved ""dogfaces.""  pyle may not have thought that he was doing anything of importance, yet his articles served to bring the war home to an american public that was being fed a somewhat sugar coated version of the war by the government; in turn, the gi's loved pyle as one of their own.  he immortalized as many of them as he could in his articles, stating the names of the many men with whom he had contact, and often their full home address for good measure.  he shared many of their hardships on the front lines, and now, more than 60 years later, his articles offer an insight into wwii for today's readers that is as poignant now as it was then.  he makes the reader feel as if we know these men personally-they are our fathers, grandfathers, brothers, neighbors, friends. impossible to put down, this book is the enduring legacy of a great man whose life ended much too soon (after surviving the european theater, he traveled to the pacific at the request of the navy, where a japanese sniper took his life on the tiny island of ie shima, just off the coast of okinawa); i would recommend this book to everyone i know with an interest in wwii. brave man"	1
"regardless of some of the negative reviews i found that this book contains some of the best advice you can get about internet marketing.  some have their opinions about his book about ""how to get rich by telling other people how to get rich."" although that has some truth to it, there is so much more to it - if you think of how to apply it in your industry or niche!    what some of these reviewers fail to understand is that this book gives you the strategies on how to market your particular business effectively through using the internet, not just ""teaching people how to get rich.""  and the subtitle to this book accurately says it all, ""making money online using e-mail"" in my opinion that's what this book is about and is accurately communicated in the title.    i highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to start an online business.  although you could get most of the material for free on the internet, it's much more convenient and saves you a lot of time to have this book around. great book!"	1
if you're looking for the outrageous, eccentric, with a laugh in at least every paragraph, you just can't beat bill fitzhugh! plus , his books are great satires on contempary america. cross dressing is perhaps his most realistic, with no sci- fi overtones such as those found in pest control, an even wilder ride! here we have a socially aware nun with an unusual past, meeting up with an ad huckster in some of the funniest scenes ever written, yet everything here is certainly very possible, if not likely. his barbs at organized religion, and the huckster consumer society are all too real! truly, mr fitzhugh strikes a solid punch, and one wishes for more success for this unique, zanily- inspired author. mr. fitzhugh is one of a kind!	1
"""undine was fiercely independent and yet passionately imitative.  she wanted to surprise every one by her dash and originality, but she could not help modeling herself on the last person she met, and the confusion of ideals thus produced caused her much perturbation when she had to choose between two courses."" p.457    the characters in custom of the country were fabulous, especially elmer moffatt.  the story itself proved to be an almost inexhaustible weave of aspirations and setbacks.  the up-and-coming young new york socialite, undine spragg, with her country background and concealed past, pushes incessantly to better her personal station.  whether it is compromising her parents financial stability to marry into new york's society, crushing her first husband in favor of a richer more social benefactor, or finding her way into a scandalous second marriage with one of france's oldest families, undine never stops aspiring for more.  she ultimately concludes (seemingly so) with her very first love, elmer moffatt.  wharton leaves the reader with an unpredictable and winding path, to an inevitable conclusion. upward mobility"	1
i read this one for the first time in 1959, a year after it was published. this story has never left me.  for some reasone it left quite an impression.  recently i ran across a copy at a book sale and purchased it, took it home and read it again.  i now know why it has stayed with me all these year!  it is good!  i have, over the years read quite a number of heinlein's works and i must admit that this is probably my favorite of the bunch.  i realize that it is considered a juvenile book and it is certainly an appropriate read for the younger reader, but, as i just found out, it is quite a nice read for the older reader also.  as i remember, looking back, this book rather inspired me in many ways, and doing better in school was by no means the least.  some of heinlein's later work was rather difficult for me to digest, i.e. i simply did not like them.  i rather wish he had stuck to simply telling well told tales as he did with this one.  recommend this one highly. enjoyed it then and just enjoyed it again!	1
this book is a brilliant recreation of the personality of a conflicted genius. drunk, boor, loyal friend, egotist,poor father, generous benefactor, are all labels that could apply to john ford. this biography verifies a lot of great stories and illuminates the secrets of the man. any fan of film cannot afford to miss this work. henry fonda says ford was &quot; a son of a bitch...but a genius.&quot; you will agree. &quot; a genius between 'action' and 'cut' &quot;	1
"filling a book with applications is no good when you compress the theoretical material. this book, although nice on the application side, falls short when the going starts to get rough.  this book has chapters that are not even worth reading, like the chapter on eigenvectors and linear transformations. in general, the explanations are so short or lack demonstrations to a point where you end up memorizing theorems (a demonstration is not a paragraph in cursory english saying ""blah, blah, as we saw previously, blah, blah, blah."" if you doubt me, do that on an exam and see what the professor writes in red ink, later). is that what you want ? the serious student will then waste his/her precious little time trying to fill in the gaps with other books. i'm not even talking from the standpoint of abstractness and rigour. i'm just saying explanations are lacking.   a reviewer said some problems are hard to do with the text, and 98% are done by rote. this is correct. the ""hard"" problems are hard because the book is lacking in abstraction. another reviewer said this book will please engineers more than mathematicians. i feel this is correct too. applied mathematics students should also avoid this book. i don't think this book prepares you for ""the next level"", where you'll be working with real problems. i don't see this book preparing the student for computational linear algebra, and i don't think there's nearly enough matrix theory here. also, i think the book has that american textbook style where things are broken into small pieces and fit into nice-looking boxes and the text tends to loose its flow and you tend to loose the conections. it's not a good writing style for my taste.  it's kind of like a calculus book. they lie to you first, and then they teach you ""advanced calculus"" and ""analysis."" personally, i don't like that approach, because i think it's a time waster. and, you might not get a second chance to ge it right as an undergraduate (this is true for engineering students at my institution).  quickly immerse yourself in ""matrix analysis and applied linear algebra"" by c. d. meyer and avoid this book; or, another great book (and everybody says so, because it is), gilbert strang's ""linear algebra and its applications."" the virtues i see on this book are carefully chosen illustrations that help to convey meaning to the theorems by geometric aid and the intertwined applications ""appetizers.""   all in all, though, it'll do you more harm than good. students who enjoyed this book have probably haven't read any other.  this review refers to the 2nd edition. use your time wisely - avoid this book"	2
in the spring semester of 2004, mr. rubinstein was my trigonometry teacher.  for those of you in new york state, that's the equivalent of the last term of sequential math iii or the last term of the math b curriculum.  being a tenth grader at the time, i found his methods of teaching to be one of the best.  not only did i enjoy being a student in his class, but i also enjoyed learning math and because of him, i continued to pursue advanced math classes.    when he made a mistake, he was never afraid to let us correct him.  he is a humble man and is able to connect with his students on a personal level.  there was never anything fake about him.    now that i am a senior in stuyvesant hs, i look back and see that i never had a math teacher, or teacher of any subject, quite like mr. rubinstein.  there are only a few teachers like him and i feel lucky to have been taught by him.    if his book is anything like the way he teaches, then many people will learn from him by reading this book. he knows what he's talking about	1

i don't have much to say that hasn't already been said, but i felt it important enough to pipe in and agree with most of the negative comments. the book is unnecessarily complicated, skips non-obvious steps in the examples, provides no review for material that justifiably should be reviewed, and has a very poor approach to explanation of concepts. contrasted to james stewart's calculus book that i've used for the past year, this book almost makes me want to cry and turn into an english major. the key to surviving a class that requires this book is to get another book. i'm a berkeley student, for whatever that's worth. very poorly written	0
huge disappointment. trace wasn't that good either. having read all scarpetta's previous storiesbut i was hoping trace would be only bad one. however, the downhill trend seems to continue. these two books are not the usual intelligent plots cornwell is capable of writing. save your money, don't buy it. i completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so i won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details. the worst of them all	0
i assign this book to students in my psychology seminar.  these students at a women's college tell me that they find women and desire to be thought provoking, interesting, even helpful.  i noticed a column in newsweek by anna quindlen in october.  she argued that women today still need the f word feminism because society hasn't changed as much as we like to tell ourselves.  it appears that the need for books such as this one by polly young-eisendrath continues to be valid. is feminism the f word?	1
this has helpful stuff in it. i even went out and bought a stopwatch to time certain tasks to speed myself up, as this book recommends. but the time obsession is kind of ridiculous at times, to the point where you almost expect mr. mccormack to say, &quot;if you could shave making love to your wife from 15 minutes down to 15 seconds, you'd save so much time.&quot; to get philosophical, abraham maslow wrote the seminal book toward a psychology of being where he writes of the &quot;self-actualized&quot; personality, that he considers the most highly evolved personality type, but who are less than 1% of the population. one common trait amongst these extremely happy people is they often experience &quot;peak experiences&quot; where they feel immense joy and these experiences &quot;trascend time.&quot; these people lose track of time during these experiences!!!! now, it seems an obsession with time such as mccormack preaches would completely interfere with one's ever having such joyful experiences. i suppose it's like a lousy movie, where you are always looking at your watch, versus a great movie, where you forget about everything but the movie. so, i suppose to be successful and efficient, you have to say good-bye to happiness in a big way. but it's success that is supposed to make you happy, right? a major contradiction!. illuminating	1
"apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to rawls and bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). to look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and justice, according to rawls' formula). if the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral justice, again, according to rawls. because, according to rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. how? by compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. so those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. so those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because ""society"" (the robin hoods and rawls of the world) deemed this as moral justice. rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an ""a"" vs. students who earn an ""f"". he points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. true. but that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. forcing the ""wealthier"" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't justice or moral. it would simply be an unjust law. some people see rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the bolsheviks envisioned marxism). i see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. in a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. it sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). curious. how do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? there should be societal incentives to help each other. okay. but when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?. utopia deja-vu, all over again."	0
overall, i was not impressed by this rambling and disjointed book although ferguson makes some interesting points. the book is background to a british tv series involving ferguson, and it suffers very much from being written for that format.       his basic argument is that the great wars of the 20th century tore apart the great multi-ethnic empires of great britain, russia, turkey, austria-hungary, and germany, unleashed ethnic tensions the empires had contained. this, he explains, is the reason for a lot of the violence of the century, as new nation states sorted out their ethnic identities with large-scale organized violence following.       this is, indeed, a very fertile field and ferguson unearths the mass graves with relish. we are presented with the familiar parade of horribles -- kaiser bill, hitler, stalin, pol pot, etc., and a huge section on the pogroms against the jews in central europe and the nazi extermination efforts. the narrative tends to jump around quite a bit, something i would attribute to the tv format of keeping viewers interested, but it's a little disconcerting for armchair readers.       but in the end, ferguson is unconvincing. i don't think he has fully thought through his thesis here. unexplored is the question of why some 20th century wars of liberation, for example ireland's, had low death rates, while the establishment of others like turkey were so murderous. there were bitter ancient ethnic and religious issues in both ireland and turkey, and yet both took different routes. also ignored are instances where threatened ethnic wars were largely averted, as in the case of canada after the british empire collapsed, and indonesia after the dutch withdrew.       i found him also fighting a straw man. he beats down the theory that the wars involved class conflict, and insists ethnic divisions are more significant in explaining the carnage than class. perhaps soviet historians presented this view, but i thought 1989 resolved the debate about marxist interpretations of history.       which brings up a final point. ferguson muses about why the last decade of the 20th century should be so quiet, compared to all that happened. i might think that the collapse of the soviet empire resolved the last issue of the wars of the 20th century by declaring another big loser. disappointing	2

i liked this book up until the ending.  i expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what i thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power grisham gave the cia throughout this entire book.  instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me. really bad ending	2
i'm sure that somewhere in this book there is a story, but it wasn't worth the cost of finding it.  started reading this and got 100 pages into it before saying enough with all the obscure references, historical meanderings, and pointless speculations.  seems like this book's real purpose is to test the reader's intellectual bona fides rather than to present a well written, intriguing story.  it was a slog and people who want to give it great ratings, i think, do so because they're afraid people will think them stupid if they tell the truth.  call me stupid then, but this book needed a good editor and someone to tell this pretentious author to move the story along once in a while and lighten up on the obscure/pointless ramblings. my congratulations to those who managed to get to the end of this 533 page snooze fest.  you have my admiration for your tenacity.    i note that people usually rate one or two star reviews as unhelpful.  but take a look at lots of reviews of this book.  the majority of them say it is a long, boring slog, then they give it a 3 star rating.  how helpful is that?. a pretentious slog	0
"james loewen's ""lies"" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm american institutions. loewen's praise of a figure like john brown does nothing to further this end. i do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but i do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers.     i am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of christopher columbus bashing. it serves no interests to villify columbus in the name of historical accuracy. all who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. loewen rails on about the ""exploitative"" element in columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for african discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. similarly, his accusation of lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. it is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. both the author and i agree that history is written by the victors, so why does loewen rehash this ad nausem?    loewen asks the question, ""how is one supposed to feel about the america that has been presented?"" my answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. his criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. students do need to become, in loewen's words, ""crap detectors."" students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much i think we would agree. a critical indictment of high school history texts"	2

"the book delivers what it promises: a modern look on the abramelin operation and the possible procedures involved in obtaining the so called knowledge and conversation with your holy guardian angel, samadhi, or whatever your label of choice is for this ineffable experience you are after. just like ""the new hermetics"" (another title by the same author which i sincerely recommend for those with an interest in magick and/or nlp...and how big is the difference between the two after all?), 21st century mage keeps an eye on the past and tradition, while at the same time cutting through whatever may be superfluous, and keeping a very effective, non-dogmatic, outcome-oriented attitude. if you have a general interest for the abramelin operation and are after a good read, or if you are looking for the book that finally makes it sound feasible, explains how, and spurs you to seriously invest your time to do it, 21st centruy mage definitely has its place on your bookshelf. a new effective look on the abramelin operation"	1
the author has a talent for making even interesting topics deadly dull. forget this one. lots of information but too dull to read!	0
i ordered this book and eventually amazon cancelled the order because it was not available.  the then ask me to review it?  where is it?    rev bruce. where is it?	0
"as a beginning blogger, i was disappointed with this book.  i generally like the dummies series and have found them useful and entertaining.  this one is not.  the author is sarcastic -p. 3 ""what you're not to read - i forbid you to read trashy novels from the supermarket.""  really!  the information on blogger doesn't add anything that can't be found on blogger help screens.  several blogging services, for example edublog, are not mentioned at all.  last, the part of tens was not as neat as in most of the dummies books.  i want my money back. waste of money"	2
this book is of the highest quality, from its hard cover, to its glossy pages, to the photographs and historical records. this is the most detailed account of urban warfare in stalingrad i have ever read. the book is fast-paced, easy to follow, thoroughly researched, and extremely informative. i could not put this book down and learned more about the streetfighting in stalingrad than from all the other books i have read combined. if you want to learn about the horrific fighting in stalingrad from a first-person perspective, this is the highest quality work i have encountered. i recommend it to anyone with an interest on the subject and can assure you that you will not be disappointed. a first class historical work all the way. impressive!     (on a side note, i specifically looked for the author emphasizing that he was only doing his job and only found one reference. so, i have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewer who stated that this was a repeat issue. absolutely superb work - a must have for eastern front buffs!  	1
this collection consists mostly of the last stories in the past through tomorrow.  ptt may well be one of heinein's masterworks, a collection of short stories that retells history from the late 1890's but puts the world on a different course. by lopping off the last few short stories, this collection looses the continuity that made the ptt a great read. . go get the past through tomorrow	2
this book is more of a magazine (with advertisements!).  while it has many cute pages that parents have made with a photo or two, the descriptions of how each page was done are only useful for people who have enough scrapbooking experience to recognize the brief and sometimes obscure references to paper and lettering sources.  there are almost no explanations of how the pages were created (no step by step instructions or tips or anything) except to identify the sources of the products used.  a big disappointment. cute but no substance	2
while prior reviews have criticized mr. roosevelt's writing style, and justly so, he never claimed in the book to be a novelist by trade.  but his description of the way the military operated before the turn of the century is very insightful into a time long gone which will never return.  today, there is no way the us military would accept civilian volunteers with only 30 days training to fight on the front lines against battle hardened soldiers from spain or anywhere else.  to fully appreciate this book, you need to read it in context of that changing time between the civil war and ww-i.  indeed, the way the us military accepted back into its ranks former confederate officers was almost a shock to read, but understandable given the desire for the nation to heal its wounds after the civil war.  for those individuals who appreciate learning history from participants instead of modern, revisionist historians who have never spent a day in the military, i would highly recommend this book.  this book is one i'll read again. roosevelt's place in history	2
"i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was ""beep beep!  pretentious young writer peddling so-called bad childhood experiences for fame, money and sympathy.""  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style. pretentious garbage"	0
the prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  i was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  i mean graceland for a first date?  i noticed a lot of similarities between roz and the mayor in northern lights, and logan and nate from that same book.  none of them can talk in complete sentences.  and stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  there is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which i didn't bother to read because i just couldn't torture myself any longer.  and i'm a big fan of roberts.  i love her quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  but this just stunk because i could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  i'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out. was this a novel or a horticulture manual?	2
this novel highly disappointed me and i'm a big james patterson fan. the usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so i don't like too many characters that i have to remember. but i stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, i kept telling myself...no way. but, it ended the way it ended. i purchased this one, but i think maybe i'll get the next patterson release from the library. i think the two star rating pretty well sums it up. not one of patterson's better novels	2
okay- i know that this is a seminal work re: the middle east, but it is as dry as any other history text that you might find on the shelves of middleeast 101.  in comparison to price of honor or other more reader friendly texts that in my opinion carry as much critical information about the volatile region, it pales in comparison. a history text	2
being a child of the self indulgent baby-boomer generation this book shook me to my roots, not only by how different things were then but by how similar they are now.    as i read this book i couldn't help but be amazed by how the characters, whether on a personal or a societal scale, mirrored those we see today.    most of all herman wouk provides a crystal clear view of the events leading up to ww ii. the characters are memorable, though i feel that this is wouk's shortcoming in this book. the historical characters seem to be developed more strongly than the fictional characters of the henry family, around which this book centers. i feel that wouk left the main characters purposely undefined as a way to make them appear more complex. the historic characters didn't suffer from this, perhaps because wouk had to rely on historical accounts of them.    this books seems to hold up well for historical accuracy and provides an incomparable sense of perspective for anyone wishing to learn more than just the facts of that era.    i prefer to read classics and believe this book might be easy to trash on that level but the story itself and the realism with which wouk tells it makes this one of the very best books i have read to date.     this is an imoprtant book that should be read by everyone wishing to understand the events leading up to world war ii. it can happen again and as i write this in late 2005 it seems likely it will. a must read as we enter ww iii	1
"breaking through to teens: a new psychotherapy for the new adolescence is a cutting-edge psychology book by award-winning academic author ron taffel, ph.d., founder of family and couples treatment services at the institute for contemporary psychotherapy in new york city. breaking through to teens blends crucial insights into teen culture with the hard-earned knowledge of what can get through to the troubled adolescents of today's world. from the basic conditions kids need to feel ""held"", to clear means for breaking through parent-teen gridlock, to creating ""flexible confidentiality"", and getting teens to speak up, breaking through to teens is extremely valuable both as a parenting resource and as a professional sourcebook of general understanding and specific techniques for youth psychologists and family counselors. highly recommended especially for psychology reference shelves. extremely valuable both as a parenting resource and as a professional sourcebook of general understanding"	1
so lush and rich and vivid; and yet sullied by racism.  what a tragedy that icredibly beautiful writing like this is now compromised by sensitivities that wolfe did not perceive.  a flaw that should be forgiven and yet is so difficult to do when confronted with the ugly racism of some passages.  however, if one can forgive, wolfe is without doubt the greatest american writer. beauty and the beast	2
these are truly a wonderful grouping of books that everyone should read if not own. i loved the movies and couldn't keep waiting to find out what happens, so bought the books. read them all 1-6 in about 6 days...just couldn't put them down. lighthearted reading that is enjoyable. harry rocks	1
as a university professor of human resource development and an anglican brother, the amazing power of deliberate intent is pure drivel and has no redeeming value whatsoever. if you enjoy new-age fantasy, get a copy from your local library otherwise do not waste your money. if you are serious about spiritual growth you might read works such as the rule of benedict: insights for the ages, or the best selling book on spiritual development of all time.. it's called the bible. the amazing power of drivel	0

"i read parts of this ""book"" until my intelligence was thoroughly insulted and i immediately returned it to the library. what a stultifying simpleton this man is. he is someone who wants to appear to have all the answers without having any foundation of intelligent ideas. and unsurprisngly, this dolt absolutely embarrassed himself during a recent appearance on the ""david letterman show"" and what made matters worse was just how oblivious he was to his infinite stupidity. first, he claimed that no one should criticize president bush ""because we're at war and it's no good for the country."" come again? i say that such a statement is ""no good"" for democracy, which is something this submental gasbag has forgotten about. the right to openly disagree with an alderman or a president is guaranteed by the first amendment. and this man is a graduate of the john f. kennedy school of government? also, he insisted that cindy sheehan, whose son was killed in iraq, not have the right to be publicly upset with president bush and the invasion of iraq because ""she's connected with left-wing elements in this country."" what left-wing elements? i feel that cindy sheehan is as connected to left-wing elements as much as bill o'reilly is associated with logical reasoning. a banal and brainlessly belligerent buffoon"	0
although fantasies were given by &quot;regular&quot; people, i found the descriptions of making it with dogs and dreaming of what you'd do to your baby neice, not only objectionable, but just plain gross. i don't think your average person would appreciate such fantasies. based on other  reviewers here, i thought it would be about really erotic/possibly romantic  escaapades. i had no idea it would be bizarre and ugly. i think there were  2 i liked, but they were just so-so. i wonder about an author that provides  a forum for such material. not for the squeamish	0
"i'm a long time fan of the anna pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. unfortunately, ""hard truth"" does not live up to the quality of ms. barr's earlier works. it feels very contrived. it also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. this book just does not meet the expectations i've come to expect from the series. pretty poor effort"	0

this is a very indepth library for an aspiring ccna. these books are packed full of entry-level cisco and networking knowledge. however, do not rely on these books alone to pass the ccna. be sure to pick up todd lammle's ccna book to prepare you for the test. good ccna book, but don't let it be your only one...	2
one word of caution to people about this book.  there are many abridged versions out there so be careful to find one that is not.  i originally picked up one at a used book sale, got it home and was astonished to find that it had only 400pp.  i thought this was odd, so i searched about on the internet and realized that others were over 1000pp. long.  needless to say, i went out and found an unabridged version to read.  thankfully i realized my mistake early on.    as far as the story itself goes, i was pleased with my first experience with dickens.  i like a good 19th century novel filled with the ornate language and customs of the day.  i very much liked dicken's overtly satirical and even subtly derisive way of writing about issues like courts and aristocracy.  even after almost 150 years, his views still ring true.      i look forward to reading more of his books. my first dicken's experience	1
bryson is a pretty good writer. his prose is flowing and very easy to read. this book is 300 pages and i read it in 3 days.     my complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. he made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. plus, this is a book about traveling across america. i don't mind americans complaining about what's wrong here. i do it myself occasionally. i don't mind people in other countries criticizing the usa. i make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. but there is something grating about americans living in other countries coming back to travel the usa and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. stay in england if it's so bad here. snarky not funny	2
"i can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.     the acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring.  it's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. i do not recommend it, i would give it zero stars if it was possible.     the child actress ""mary"" and then the older grown up ""mary"" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful!  watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money!. worset movie ever"	0
i did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  while it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  i also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  i totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  the only reason that i read this was because it was for my book club.  the reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  there was no in-between.  i would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to english majors, i'm not sure who else would like it. smartly written, unique story, but not for me 	2
this book isn't a masterpiece, but it does tell the story of one of america's best pilots. it tells the life of bob hoover from his eyes. the stories he tells are almost unbelievable! it was a very entertaining book,  i could hardly put it down, and i would recommend it for anyone who is  interested in aviation, especially those who like to hear great stories of  how aviation has changed over the years. great story	1
"i've been a fan of heinlein's sf for just about as long as i've been an sf fan at all (somewhere around thirty-five years). but when i read this collection some twenty-odd years ago, it nearly turned me off to the old man altogether.    the fiction is pretty good (although even that isn't heinlein's best). but to describe the nonfiction accurately, i'd have to use words that amazon will remove from the review anyway.    for the most part, the pieces collected here represent a side of heinlein i strongly dislike. though i respect _starship troopers_, it's never going to be my favorite heinlein novel no matter how many times we quibble over the precise definition of ""fascism"" -- and i'm not going to have much respect for the nonfiction in this collection.    and mind you, it's not because i disagree with heinlein's opinions; it's because he gave bad arguments for them and called other people nasty names when they differed. some of the stuff collected here is tendentious to the point of being propagandistic. (at least in his fiction, he was able to create characters with points of view that differed from his and get into their heads well enough to present them sympathetically -- in short, to grok them. not here, boy.)    heinlein (who bought into the korzybski/general semantics fad pretty early on) spent a lot of years dismissing philosophers as tailchasers who derive their premises from their conclusions. but his own attempt at philosophy, as represented here in e.g. ""the pragmatics of patriotism"", is very nearly the worst writing on ethical philosophy i've ever seen.    then, too, people who knew heinlein report that despite his overall gentlemanly demeanor, he could be pretty churlish toward people who disagreed with him. well, he's certainly unpleasant here; anybody who doesn't agree with him on the need for massive nuclear buildup is dismissed as a poltroon or a custard-head. even in the unlikely event that i thought he were _right_, i wouldn't find this a very helpful approach.    perhaps more surprisingly, his popular writings on _science_ aren't very good. asimov's reputation as the ""great explainer"" is in no danger here.    this volume is second only to _grumbles from the grave_ in cementing heinlein's posthumous reputation as a rather mean-spirited fellow whose fictional characters were generally much better company than he was. when i want heinleinian company, i'll stick to d.b. davis, manuel garcia o'kelly davis, and (maybe) lazarus long.    and when i want to read some humane nonfiction by an sf master, i'll still turn to asimov. i credit heinlein with three magisterial novels, several imperfect-but-great ones, and a good number of brilliant short stories. but the stuff in this book should have stayed in his drawer. almost turned me off to heinlein"	0
this book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. the writing here is a knockoff of michael crighton and really doesnt juve very well. i found myself skimming the pages after a while. the subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again. interesting plot but bad details	2
"i admit, i haven't finished this book.  a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia.  i was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels.  granted, i am not a firm believer in just ""the hard facts"" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her!. lost credability, quickly!!"	2
as a lover and avid collector of books, i had high hopes for this book -- at first glance it seemed entrancing, especially the topic.  unfortunately, once i started reading it more carefully, my spirits sank.  some of the  pictures are visually interesting, but most are not.  even more  disappointing, there is not much substantive information either.  if you  like the idea of this book and are looking for a more satisfying read,  check out at home with books : how booklovers live with and care for their  libraries by estelle ellis(editor), et al.  that book is worth every penny,  and you'll enjoy it. i disliked this book so much i returned it!	0
well i bought this book hoping that i could have more breakfast ideas especially now that my children are going to school full time and i dislike processed cereals. i am a domestic engineer who has studied culinary arts specializing in pasteries. all i have to say is that the recipes that i have tried taste alright but the timing is off. some pancake recipes call for a little much baking powder that gives the hotcakes a soapy flavour. some things taste good but be warned!	2
"it's no secret that people who are trying to sell you something will be very careful and sometimes dishonest when it comes to the actual words and phrases they use to describe their product.  in talking right, linguist geoffrey nunberg examines the use of language manipulation as it has been used in modern american politics and the effect it has had back on the language itself.    since the birth of advertising, sellers would spend many hours writing and rewriting slogans, bumper-stickers and sales pitches to make sure that each word had the desired impact on the listener.  but nunberg's research is more interested not just in how language is utilized by the political salespeople, but how certain words and phrases in the vernacular have ended up being subtly changed by constant repetition and reenforcement from politicians, pundits and spin-meisters.      while the word ""liberal"" is obviously where the book hangs its hat, other words and phrases have also migrated to take on different meanings and connotations.  for example in a political context, when someone refers to ""values"", they actually are only discussing a small subset of possible moral issues, regardless of their position on other subjects.  even a word as old as ""christian"" is taking on a more restrictive definition.         talking right is written in an easy-to-read style.  it's breezy and almost conversational without feeling shallow.  i found to it be a little repetitive at times (odd, considering the relatively small word-count), but i forgive it because of all the little facts that i hadn't know.  i had, for example, recently noticed republicans referring to their opponents as ""the democrat party"".  but i hadn't realized that the deliberate shortening of ""democratic"" has been a tactic going back over 70 years.  the book is told mainly from a liberal point of view.  this is because of nunberg's thesis (and i think that most would agree) that the right-wing has been far more successful at branding words and phrases as belonging to their side of the national discussion.    nunberg picked up on a lot of things that seemed familiar to me.  things that i had noticed but hadn't realized that i noticed.  it's a very illuminating book in that way; it crystallizes a lot of things i had only half-realized while listening to left-wing and right-wing talking heads exchanging insults on cable news. right?  right."	2
"what is the longevity of john bradshaw's book, and how does his writing stand up in the perspective of time?  the book was published over ten years ago, and it seems to have dropped through the cracks of the large and populous human growth floorboards, of which it was a part.    the first thing i noticed about bradshaw's writing is its sheer verbosity.  he writes in a roundabout way, rather than concisely and to the point.  contrast him, for example, with a writer on buddhism or taoism (say, alan watts?).      writing on buddhism or taoism may provide authors with a natural impetus to be concise, but the human growth movement is broad and billowy, and concise writing may not be important to the authors.      and bradshaw seems to drag in every alley cat he ever heard meow in the human growth movement, to help him reflect on what he sees as the underlying principle of it all: shame.    bradshaw reports that he is a theologian, but also someone who recovered from alcoholism, and was deeply shamed as a child, which shame he finally learned to deal with and overcome.      there are many fine snippets from his book, which may be of use to folks, but overall, i think most people looking for direction are going to be repelled by his constant conceptualizations.  to paraphrase another well-known quotation, ""people cannot live on concepts alone.""    if he had given more personal studies or little case histories, it would have been much more helpful.  instead, he includes page after page of some ""guided"" meditations or shame inquiries, which were totally useless to me.  if you are looking for guided meditations, this is the place for you.      so, in all, bradshaw's book does not hold up to scrutiny after time, in my opinion.  it's one of the many from its era and niche that was forgotten and will be unlikely to remembered henceforth.  anyway, it was a bestseller once, and that's what counts, i guess.  it did have its 15 minutes of fame, and a lot of books never even get that.  diximus. for shame"	2

"i'm about 1/2 way there and its a struggle to finish - not cussler's usual - maybe because there is another author and its not his?  way too many characters - i'm no dummy, but i have to keep referring to the front of the book to remind myself which one of the ""cast of characters"" he is talking about because he switches every other paragraph to a totally different scene with totally different characters.  the story isn't bad - but beside the confusion of figuring out who he is talking about and where they are, there is so much extra non essential filler in it that it is hard to get involved in it.  i hope it gets better as it goes along, but i doubt it. i'm really working hard to finish it but its a stuggle!"	2
this 84 page book is evenly divided between intstructions on how to build a brick oven and recipes for baking in it.  i have not tried the recipes. i made an impulsive purchase of this book because i have been interested in building a brick oven for some time.  i mistakenly thought that i would gain some insights and practical tips that were missing from the bread builders by daniel wing and alan scott.  i did not. there is, in my opinion too little detail in this book to actually construct a quality oven. disapointing	0
"this book is an amalgam of the author's experience as a serial high tech entrepreneur and good business common sense.  it provides a compendium of advice that one cannot find in more traditional business books and texts.  it is for those who are thinking about starting a company -- especially, but not necessarily, a high tech company -- and are not certain what to do next or first.  it addresses the ""seed stage"" of a new venture, primarily before venture capital is raised, when the team is first being assebled and the vision and product are first being formed.  a must read for the first time high tech entrepreneur.. practical advice for high tech entrepreneurs"	1
i have recently completed reading babywise ii. i consider myself a christian and this book is extremely popular in my church. throughout the entire book, i had moments of complete confusion and disagreement accompanied by moments of complete agreement and lucidity regarding how to implement these methods. however, by the end, i realized that i should not be confused by or passionately against any section of a book that would truly benefit my child.     while i believe there are some helpful and necessary methods in the book, i had already found much of that advice in other sources. for example, feeding schedules are advocated by many resources, but those other sources are very clear when it comes to making sure babies' basic needs are met before implementing such routines. with my knowledge from other resources, i attempted to read babywise with a bit of grace, but at the same time i felt guilt and coercement at many points; for instance, when i realized that my child was having one more meal a day than what is 'recommended' by mr. ezzo for a child her age. for the record, my pediatrician generally recommends one more meal than she is receiving for a child her age.     this concern and my confusion on other subjects in the book prompted me to speak to my husband about the book and i asked him to read it. he read only the forward and immediately became suspicious. he asked me if there were any references and i instantly realized there were none. it then became clear that the pediatrician listed as an author indeed had no authorship save the foreword, and that mr. ezzo has had no formal education regarding child development. a very quick search on the internet confirmed our deductions, and we found many articles against mr. ezzo's methods, including a well documented student's masters thesis. out of curiosity and still trying to find a way to defend this popular book, i performed internet searches on all of the other resources on child development we own (four books; all of which document research for their claims and advice) and found absolutely no negative press for any.     based on how unclear i found the teachings in the book and how much bad advice i had to sort out, i strongly urge anybody who reads this book to read other books first. as i said, i don't disagree with all of the methods and advice, but it should be seen as advice from a person who has raised obedient (not a bad thing) children and has no other qualifications beyond that. you could do just as well asking advice from a friend or acquaintence with children who possess qualities you admire. as we all know every child is different and reacts to different discipline methods differently. please make sure you go to many resources to find the option best suited to your child.     just an end note: as popular as this book is among my friends, i have not known anybody to follow the babywise book beyond feeding schedules and sleeping issues,  and there is a good reason for that: not all of it is good advice. read other books first	2
i thought this book had some good points.  ppl should see this book as advice and not follow things so literally.  i noticed many reviews, ppl did not agree with her about breastfeeding.  i notice that she tries not to pressure moms into breastfeeding.  after my baby was born, i felt pressured to breastfeed. good advice	2

"it had been way too long since i picked up a heinlein title: ""stranger in a strange land"" being the last time i ventured into his densely written world 15 years ago.    the book touts that this is ""science fiction's most controversial novel""...and i can see that since it was written in 1964.  however, the disturbing elements of slavery, incest, and cannibalism cetainlty transcend time.    as for the storyline, it is inetersting and well put together.  this book seemed to me like two stories in one.  the first half could be entitled ""the survivalist guide after the complete destruction of the world as we know it"" and i shall be certain to take this book with me for reference in the (un)liklihood i ever find myself in a bomb shelter or lost in the woods.      the story finally takes a turn halfway through when we are introduced to the inhabitants of this future earth.  the ""color war"" has taken a turn and now dark skinned folk are the masters and the light skinned people are the slaves.  this new world is explained in detail as well as how the caste system works.    our main characters adapt as best as they can according to their individual personalities.  i do not entirely agree that there is nothing to like about farnham's clan.  it is a cross section of the kind of personalities that make up the world: leaders, fighters, followers, cowards, dependants, etc.  the strong survive and the weak get sucked into and accept their lot (even learn to like it).      the time travel twist is one of the only features that make this title ""sci-fi"".  other than that, it can be looked upon as any other interesting work of fiction.    if you can muddle through the first half of the book, dense with dialogue and technicalities that will make your head spin, you're in for a good read.  this book will make you think and consider how different a world can be if roles were reversed and democracy was no more. a different world"	2
"like so many bad, bad movies, this book is a beautiful production.  it features slick, heavy paper; a million color pictures; attractive, readable typeface; witty contributors.  its proportions seem just right for its weight.    but unless you just love grazing on hors d'oeuvres (and many do), you're likely to be disappointed by this beautiful but cynical exercise in marketing to the culturally insecure.  as somebody has already noted: no iliad.  no odyssey. no aeschylus. no euripides. no boccaccio. no chaucer. no dante.  no machiavelli. no shakespeare. no marlowe.     no old or new testament. no q'uran. no lao-tse, confucius, bhagavda-gita (really short and really good). no beowulf. no sir gawain and the green knight.    in fact, only 13 works from before 1700 make the cut - and lest you think fun is the criterion, one of them is john lyly's euphues long regarded as one of the most unreadable and, shall we say, ""affected"" works in english literature. you get john lyly instead of john milton.       on the other hand, you do get 69 titles of books that have appeared since 2000.  that's a lot of ""classics"" in record time.  how did they pick these?  and there's another 700 - out of 1001, if you can dig it, ""you must read before you die"" written in the 20th century.    the 19th century is well represented, i'll grant. huck finn is here - but not twain's more complicated letters from the earth, the mysterious stranger, a connecticut yankee, or pudd'nhead wilson.      they also felt it necessary to fill out the list with a few short stories like lovecraft's ""the mountains of madness"" and gogol's ""the nose.""  great stories, but two actual books had to go to make room for them.  books like the red badge of courage, for example.      or maybe the red badge got crowded out by justine or american psycho.    this is a book for people who like to read about books in snappy reviews, and look at color pictures of books. you'll find some titles worth pursuing, but you could do better, for starters, just by getting a list of cliff's notes titles and going on from there.     you can do that for free. just 1001 books some prof likes"	0

it is alright to present an alternative point of view, but it is not right to attack other recovery programs, especially those with a proven track record. i suspect mr. trimpey has an axe to grind or is just hostile to the spiritual underpinnings of 12-step programs.the truth is that one size does not fit all. some methodswork for some people and other methods work for others. read this book and try this method. if it does not work try another one. they are all good in their own way. but mr. trimpey: if one person, who cannot be helped by your method, ignores other options because of your attack on aa, you should be ashamed of yourself. too biased	0
i read this book such a long time ago, and i purchased it for my son to read also.  this book was the one that made me and advid reader and it is so important for every young adult to read it whether african american or other nationality.  it is simply good journalism!  you can really feel where the author is trying to go with his dialogue.  it puts peer pressure, city life, drugs, right in the faces of the young adult.  it also helps young adults find a solution to an everyday problem.  a great gift for any reader.  this is something to keep in your library for all times. simply a must read!	1
i know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. it went into great detail about what i should do if i got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of morning sickness, which is much more common.   and some of the information was just plain wrong. i trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because i couldn't feel the baby move. it advised that i should call the doctor. when i did, i found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. unfortunately i found this out after i had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong.  i would not suggest this book to anyone. didn't really like it	2
"this is one of the worst (maybe the worst) books i have ever read. the actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book. the rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing. the author and the publisher are insulting the intelligence of readers by publishing such a stupid book.     the technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in technical analysis (ta). in the ta terminology, it is called support and resistance levels. if you are interested in this technique, use one of the books on ta. those books cover it in much more rigor than darvas' book and they cover a lot more ta techniques that are much more powerful. my favorite book on ta is ""how technical analysis works"" by bruce kamich.      husam abu-haimed, ph.d. one of the very worst!"	0

barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. it works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the war in iraq has shown us. overly simplistic..	2
"even though this is a ""popular"" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. it might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in physics. i offer myself as an example: i'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. his reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). in brief, einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization. come back later"	2
i love the scarpetta books, but i had to force myself to finish this one.  the plot was disjointed, and the use of the english language was atrocious.  i can't believe she published this.  it is absolutely not up to par.  if you're going to waste your time on this book, get it from a library so you don't waste your money as well. hated it	0
this book has nothing to offer, except for those of you who now nothing about orisha tradition, and are curious. otherwise don't waste your time and money.. very light book... don't recommend it	2
second time i've bought this book because it's so helpful.  a must for  sales, or any interpersonal dynamics - family, etc.  very well written, concise, easy to understand and put theory into practice.  read it and then get others to, so you can discuss and appreciate the theory and use it to make daily communication so much easier. great book	1
what a waste. the book is very general in nature. no concrete information on the business itself. the book is not properly bound as it is completely falling apart. save your money and invest it elsewhere. very disappointed	0
"blum's biography of harlow does an excellent job of examining the man and the scientist, ""warts and all."" yes, it's unflinching in its descriptions of the experiments performed on macaques showing the effects of maternal deprivation; yes, it's unflinching on showing the psychology of the man who performed these experiments and the sad effects his psychological predispositions had on his personal life. poor monkeys! poor harlow! but never fear; blum is here to provide us with reassurance: it all had to be that way - really, it did. true, the experiments sound really nasty; but hey, that's just how things were done in those days. really, it's all okay, in the long run, because now, even though we still musn't question the basic scientific premises regarding the necessity of animal research, at least we don't have to perform those particular nasty experiments anymore; and really - really - harlow was, in his own perverted way, something of a hero. even animal rights activists have cause to be thankful to him: because of him, we now have a convenient enemy to vilify, not to mention that desperately needed scientific proof positive that monkeys are more complex than we once believed, and hence deserve a little extra consideration. thank you, harry harlow. thank you, deborah blum, for puffing him back up again after the deflated view you left us with in the monkey wars. see people? he really wasn't such a bad guy after all.  all you have to do is look at him in just the right way. . . . what a disappointment"	2
i just wanted to add another vote of confidence for this marvelous dictionary.  i got through 4 years of college latin with it, and almost never failed to find the word i was looking for.  i particularly appreciate the idiomatic expressions highlighted in bold typeface, to make it easy to skim down the definition to find the one you're looking for.  its only downfall is that, as a paperback, it begins to get a bit well-thumbed, leading the serious latinist to think, a little wistfully, that it would be nice if it came in a hardbound edition.  but for a mere six bucks, you can easily afford to buy a replacement.  personally, i own two. best darn latin dictionary on the market	1
a superb literary work ! when i read carlos's writings, it brought tears to my eyes. he was writing about my father and mother's hardships and triumps in the 1950's livermore and pleasanton area of california. we were  one of the first filipino families of that area and my parents worked hard  through all the hardships to graduate five children from major california  universities. as filipino americans we owe much to the manong generation.  many of the manong generation are buried with full military honors. many  have fought and died alongside their brothers from the midwest, the south  and all over america.it's a tribute to a proud segment of the greatest  generation of america , the wwii generation. the tears of my father and mother	1
this is only the second anne tyler book i've read and i'm not impressed. the book was depressing. i had hope as the book progressed that the main character would &quot;triumph&quot; over her circumstances but instead she subsumed her own dreams for her husband's wants and needs. anne tyler implies that this is a noble sacrifice but i thought it was weak. she should have left her loser husband. weak women -- an anne tyler speciality	2

"i read the reviews here before purchasing this book and was encouraged by some of them. in addition to this book, i purchased illustrator cs killer tips and adobe illustrator cs idea kit. now, not to the insult the author, but this book was horrifying. i felt like i was reading a boring, difficult college textbook! i'm not new to adobe or the interface, and i self-taught myself elements and photoshop. i must say that i was severely dissapointed by the lack of visual aid, visual detail, and failure to get me intrigued - how could i be with pages and pages of text to read with one or two pictures of angles or crappy artwork? i have to find another illustrator book so i actually learn something...what a dissapointment! the cd was also relatively dissapointing - nothing was interactive and was not at all well-explained in the book or the content on cd. plus, some of the lessons were advertisements for steuer's online classes. ha! the only good thing was the art that it did have was in color, and color is good - which is why i gave it one more star than i would've. if you buy it, don't open the cd so you have the option of returning it. ""wow""? i think not"	2
line by line the writing is superb. ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. but here may be the problem with id. the constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. every other page is a distraction from something i wasn't sure about to begin with. one d thing after another	2
"since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:    ""really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ...""

"lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but i was disappointed by this book.  although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility.    the title says ""interpreting"" so i will allow him creative license. expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in stalin's treatise on the u.s. constitution. disappointed"	2
the relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and i failed to connect to the main character, lottie, at all.  the book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  there were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness. a long book that seems to get longer as you read it	2
liza picard's book on mid-eighteenth century london is essentially for those who like to dip into a topic and have a short attention span. though long, there is less to it than first meets the eye.  this is history-lite and as such would probably have found limited favour with dr johnson himself. ms picard has used some interesting material from medical sources of the day but her reliance on the gentleman's magazine as a source shows in the notes at the end of the book. there is little attempt to relate all this detail to the actual events of the times, so the reader is left with a far from balanced picture of what mid-eighteenth century london was really like. not what the doctor ordered!	2
as a high school teacher i was surprised and pleasantly amused to hear that jon stewart had decided to make a teacher's edition of anything.  when i found out that a colleague of mine had decided to buy the book and reference it in a history class i thought that i should look it over and see if it was worth its weight in satire.  it is definitely worth its weight in something.  i find that the daily show's viewpoint is refreshing and that jon stewart's attempts at unraveling the political veil is essential to what we consider democracy.  the citizen's guide to democracy inaction is a good reference and cocktail party conversation starter.  i think that most of the book is interesting but i wouldn't want my child to come home and quote verbatim some of the blather that is inside.  as a book for the masses sure.  as a book intended for teachers no.  i suppose that is the joke of it all.  no teacher should use this text as a real reference or they would probably end up on 60 minutes or the daily show explaining why their students were arrested for harrassing supreme court justices with naked pictures. teachers united	2
for an experienced financial professional, this text does not add much value.  the book touches upon a great many subjects, but does not appear to cover any one in any depth.  the book may be most appropriate as an introductory text on the subject on the undergraduate level but not as a practioner's desk reference.  as a professional with significant experience in investment banking with a cpa and mba, i was looking for in-depth guide to the specific mechnanics of the contoller's function. a mile wide and an inch thin	0

what exactly is positive about the koran and its view of women?  every single assertion of this polemic is either a complete fabrication or wrong.  the hadiths and sunna are not the chauvinistic part 'corrupting' the koran, if anything the opposite is true.  in surah 4:34 the koran orders the husband to beat his wife.  in numerous suras the husband is ordered to pay the equivalent of a dowry to his wife, not her family however.  the entire koranic book of 'women' is simply one law after another about 'them' which is to say the women.  the reason it is talking about 'them' when referring to women and 'us' when speaking about men is because the koran is meant for men.  there is not one equality in the entire koran dealing with women and men.  men may take four wives women, women presumably one husband.  men may have slaves and men may marry and do as they please sexually with the slaves.  no similar injunction applies for women.  men receive virgins and wine and service in heaven...the situation of women in heaven is left to the imagination, although presumably they make up the virgins.      the koran details a world of only men where women are not only chattel but are the sexual objects of the society, sold as slaves and used and then divorced at the mans pleasure.  there is not one equality.  scholars have argued that koran reformed women's rights and elevated their status because in pre-islamic arabia women had no rights and under koran they are entitled to at least a dowry and a man may not take endless numbers of wives.  this doesn't translate as equality, it translates as a male centered world, where men are masters and women are virtually property.     the fact that god in koran is not referred to as 'father' does not indicate a feminist view of god but merely reflects the very monotheistic nature of islam, certainly a valid fact that differentiates it from christianity.  however once again this is not evidence of women's rights, because the non-gender view of god doesn't change the very negative view of women's role on earth given in the koran.  if someone is going to read this they should certainly have handy an unbiased translation of the koran so they can reflect on all the laws regarding women and why those same laws do not apply equally to men, for instance one  might wonder why a wife may not beat her disobeying husband? or why the husband is not commanded to be modest?      seth j. frantzman. what is positive?  innacurate arguments	2
"martin wolf, noted financial times columnist and professional economist, has written the most readable, empassioned and convincing defence of the new global economic order to date.  wolf's approach assumes little knowledge on the part of the reader, while at the same time demanding a keen intellect to follow all of his arguments through to their conclusions.  most effective are his relentlessly convincing counters to virtually all of the objections raised by the rag-tag ""anti-globalisation"" crowd, as wolf clearly demonstrates that globalisation increases economic output and wealth everywhere and for everyone, and that without globalisation, poor countries are destined to remain poor.  wolf's main thrust is that the world needs more globalisation, not less, and he remains critical of western countries who themselves contribute to ""limited"" globalisation by continuing protectionist agricultural tariffs and retaliatory tariff and dumping practices.  in all, a complete tour-de-force, and utterly convincing that the path we are on as a world is the right one, and that the arguments of the critics are more sentimental than real. the seminal defence of globalisation"	1

"i could not put this one down.  the autism spectrum is so diverse and difficult to understand.  this book allows one to get into the mind of a child with autism and get a grasp on how he/she perceives the world around them.  things we say and do on a regular basis, are perceived very differently to someone with autism for a variety of reasons which this book covers.  activities that we may enjoy, sometimes, are simply too much, even nausiating at times for someone with autism.  these ""ten things"" that the book mentions, really opens ones eyes to a whole different way of understanding and interacting with an individual with autism. it really showed me better ways to  communicate with them. for anyone at all that has or is working with someone on the spectrum, you need to read this book.  it will help you to be more sensitive and them better.  thank you for this book. you really need to purchase this one!"	1
i bought this book because it was required (a textbook for a class i was taking).  because it was a college-level class, i was expecting a college-level textbook.  that's not what it is at all.  the book is filled with color illustrations that aren't even very helpful.  i was hoping for more reading and explanation of terms.  illustrations are great if they are used right -- to compliment the text instead of replace it.  i wouldn't recommend this book for someone who is serious about learning the ins and outs of networking. elementary school returns	2

"while this book makes some interesting points it comes across more as an anti-tradition propaganda piece than a useful treatise on martial arts.  while the author is an experienced, highly knowledgeable practitioner, his understanding of the traditional martial arts that he rails against is incomplete and oftentimes inaccurate. don't get me wrong; i certainly do not believe that the author is an idiot.  i believe that he is the victim of bad teaching, an all too common occurrence in martial arts.    for example, he states that, ""today's full-contact fighters throw devastating, lightning fast punches from a distance of less than two feet.  against this kind of speed, classical blocks and punches simply do not stand a chance.  what amazes me is how a flaw of this magnitude - and one that is taught to thousands of unknowing students every day - still exists in what are, otherwise, extremely potent arts..."" this is just flat wrong.    contrary to mr. orlando's understanding, in classical blocks the hand that is out (e.g. just punched or blocked) performs the actual block, check, or deflection, while the hand that is in chamber executes a technique designed to control the opponent's limb.  even though it is often hidden, almost all blocks in traditional karate styles utilize this check/control methodology.  in all cases, there is never ever any ""wind-up"" preceding anything.  in most traditional schools all but the most junior students understand that simple fact.    to delve deeper, the word ""uke"" translates more accurately to ""receive"" than it does to ""block.""  when viewed in this context, it may be easier to understand that practitioners typically check, deflect, or control an attack rather than meeting it force-on-force.  using the traditional check/control methodology, a practitioner's outstretched hand need only deflect an attack by a few inches to spoil its effect when contact is made close to an opponent's body.  in this fashion karateka can easily avoid being hit by even the most ""devastating"" of punches no matter how fast, or how powerfully, or even how unexpectedly they are thrown.    common misconceptions such as this one are the reason that i believe it is imperative to supplement the traditional modeling approach to instruction with interactive discussions and other teaching styles.  regardless, i hate to see this sort of stuff perpetuated...    now that i've ripped him down, i will point out that there are some redeeming concepts in this book.  for example, the author also promotes practicing martial arts in the same sort of attire one might be wearing in real life.  if you have spent your whole life barefoot in a dojo, training with loose fitting clothes, you may well be in for a shock the first time you have to fight in tight-fitting jeans wearing boots.  this is a very valid point.  i wholeheartedly agree that practitioners should devote some of their training to more realistic conditions though that often must occur at their home rather than in a tradition karate school.    all in all, however, there is not enough meat in this book for me to feel like i got my money's worth from purchasing it.  it was disappointing. get sifu orlando's book ""indonesian fighting fundamentals: the brutal arts of the archipelago"" instead. it's a great read and well worth buying.     lawrence kane  author of surviving armed assaults, the way of kata, and martial arts instructio. disappointing"	2
it is pretty general,there is no such thing as advice or anything the like about practices.he insists in almost every chapter that the mission is the most important thing.the only intersting ideas in his book are some about leadership, but i felt very much that i already knew them,he only confirmed them.this is not to say i am a genius.i am 18, so i guess if you are involved in running a nonprofit for more than one year, you would be able to write a better book.    for a beginner it might be intersting to get it from the library, and read it in a train or so.    not bad, but getting a book on leadership,and other one  on marketing is a much better idea. not bad,but neither good	2
"i had heard about the south beach diet 2 years ago through my mom and dad and sister.  they all follow it and i thought i couldn't do it because i was nursing my baby.  i wish i had tried it sooner!!!  you can do this diet while pregnant/nursing and no matter what your health situation is!  my physician said it is the only diet he will encourage people to follow.  it will work, it just takes a little discipline in the beginning (phase 1).  you get through that and it's easy street.  i started the diet on march 1st, 2006 weighing 170 lbs. and a size 16.  i weighed myself this morning and am down to 145 and a junior size 11.  i am 5' 7"" so i am technically well within my ideal weight range, but i am shooting for 140lbs.  i know it will happen any day now.  i am in phase 3 and i eat dessert (in moderation), bread (whole grain) and lots of yummy dishes!!!  i've even got my kids cooking in the kitchen with me and they eat foods you'd never believe a little kid would eat.  it's a family plan and a way of life.  i've got so much more energy that i want to exercise any chance i get now!  my whole family is healthier and happier for it.  i do recommend reading both books--read them over and over...i've read the south beach diet 4 or 5 times.  when you feel a little down or like you're falling off the wagon, read it.  it will reaffirm what you're doing and why you're doing it.  try it, you'll like it!  good luck~~juli. it works....plain and simple."	1

i live in thailand and have traveled to burma (sometimes called &quot;myanmar&quot;).  i was prepared to like this book and i was expecting the heroic life story that i got.  i was not, however, prepared for the beauty of the writing and the depth of the tragedy so simply, but touchingly, told.  it is simply amazing to me that anyone can write so beautifully in a second language; thwe is very talented.  i hope that he keeps writing.  i also hope that in his next book, he drops some of the reserve that characterizes his cultural upbringing and lets us into his inner life a little more. a touching life	1
i originally got this book when i first moved out on my own. i had some cooking experience which i gleaned from my mother, but with a limited spread of recipes and without much on-my-own experience.    this book helped me a great deal as a beginner cook, and taught me most of the basics. years later, i'm a much better cook, and though i rarely use this book's recipes at face value, i often reference it for a guideline to dishes that i enjoy, while adding my own touches. also, when i'm preparing to try something new, this is generally the first book i go to, even after all this time.    other cook books have come and gone, but this one has staying power for me, earning it its five stars. a great purchase for a young adult, or even an every-day cook who just isn't very good, or who has a limited array of recipes. it is also a great reference for anyone who just wants a base to branch out from. great go-to book	1
matt gaffney is one of only a dozen or so people in the u.s. who makes a living as a freelance crossword puzzle constructor. it's not easy and there's a lot of competition. the pay per puzzle is low and it takes hours to construct a quality puzzle. how does he do it? the same way any freelancer does it. he works his butt off. after creating some of the best puzzles around, he finds new markets, cultivates old markets, networks, looks for new angles, and acts as his own bill collector. his latest angle is gridlock, an entertaining book about the crossword puzzle business and the  eccentric people who populate it.    gridlock is a somewhat unstructured, but fun look at the crossword world from the viewpoint of a constructor. previous crossword books have profiled constructors (the crossword obsession), told how to construct crosswords (the puzzlemaker's handbook), or told of life as a crossword solver (crossworld). as far as i know, this is the first look from the constructor's point of view.     gaffney takes us behind the scenes at the annual crossword puzzle tournament. he tells us how he came to be a crossword constructor, how he nearly had to give up freelancing and get a real job, and what saved him from that awful fate. he describes what goes into the construction of a puzzle (it's more interesting than you might imagine), and tackles the computer vs. human constructor debate. he finishes up with a profile of puzzlemaker and noted recluse henry hook. with that final chapter, it's apparent that if gaffney ever runs out of work as a crossword constructor (is sudoku a passing fad or something more sinister?), he'll be able to make a career as a more traditional freelance writer. crossword puzzling for fun and profit	1
"i found this book to be based on a kernel of truth wrapped in innumerable layers of unconfirmable speculation (how many people really have access to intelligence agency archives?) and one-sided 'analysis'.  it is clear the bin ladin was 'lost' at tora bora when our troops were called back to garrison, allowing him to escape.  this goes even farther to the right than micheal moore goes to the left.    if you want a look at the subject from someone who was involved through several administrations, read ""against all enemies: inside america's war on terror"" by richard clarke.    if you buy this book, you are paying for propaganda. damage control for the current president"	0
"delightfully short in length, ""the good body"" takes a mere hour to peruse and completely read...which is a blessing.  the repetitious cliches used to re-assure women that whatever the body form or shape, the body is good.  there is nothing new to enlighten or educate the reader, and nothing one hasn't read or heard beforehand.  regardless of how compelling an argument in favor of an unaltered natural appearance the author puts forth, the bottom line is that in our global community looks and body shape do still make a difference in a woman's life choices and success.  this feminist rhetoric is no different than that which has been preached since the onslaught of ""feel good about yourself"" books in the 1960's, 70's and 80's. nothing new"	2
robert g. allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  if you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like i did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  the funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  they always show up as just a bunch of html code.  would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  but that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister allen has been in trouble with the law before.  he's had several run-ins with the irs, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  i would also stay away from his nothing down real estate methods.  many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the nothing down club in atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  for more info on allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on real estate investing, then click real estate guru ratings.  bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. and if you're reading this mr. allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!!. boycott robert g. allen!!!	0
the best out there. cant live without this awesome boo. this book rocks	1
"this is a very misleading book. there were many points that i would criticize, but it would take an entire book to do that. so i'll pick out three important issues and focus on those.    issue one: welfare and out of wedlock childbirths    one example is the effect of welfare on out of wedlock childbirths. on page 59 iceland criticizes the theory that welfare payments are responsible for increased rates of out of wedlock childbirths. iceland points to the fact that inflation-adjusted welfare payments have declined, whereas out of wedlock childbirths have increased. but single mothers are available for other assistance programs such as food stamps, public housing, and medicaid. when the full package of benefits is included, the total aid available to single mothers has kept up with inflation.     on page 136 iceland cites robert moffit's 1992 research showing that welfare has only caused a slight increase in out of wedlock childbirths. but after other researchers such as mark rosenzweig and the economists jeff grogger and stephen bronars found a large connection, moffit reexamined the issue. his more thorough methodology and found that welfare did cause a significant increase in out of wedlock childbirths. moffit reported this in 1998. why did iceland mention his 1992 research but not his 1998 research?    issue two: the color of poverty    one problem is that iceland documents the fact that poverty statistics show that most of the poor are white. on page 38 he criticizes the fact that most media reports tend to show pictures of blacks when discussing poverty, thus creating a false perception. but as iceland discusses, most poverty is short term, usually from a divorce, a death, or a lost job. on page 49 he mentions that black children make up a majority of the long term poor.    i would submit that when people think about poverty they think about long term poverty, not brief poverty spells. like it or not, americans have to grapple with the fact that entrenched, generational poverty is disproportionately black.    issue three: cause of poverty    the biggest problem with the book is its analysis of the cause of poverty. it concludes that out of wedlock childbirths are a minor cause relative to the inequality embedded in a free market, capitalist society. but the way it reaches that conclusion is through a statistical analysis in which possible causes are each treated as independent variables to see which explains the greatest amount of poverty.     but supporters of the theory that poverty is caused by out of wedlock childbirths do not blame the out of wedlock birth in itself. after all, college educated single mothers show that an out of wedlock childbirth is not necessarily a ticket to poverty. the problem is the lost opportunity in terms of the chance of graduating high school and college. page 422 of the bipartisan policy book 'the new world of welfare' documents the fact that while most out of wedlock childbirths happen to women in their 20's, half of all *first* out of wedlock childbirths happen to women in their teens (fortunately this is on the decline). this is early enough to interfere with the mother's education, and makes it much more likely that she will drop out, or not go to college. the lesson is that the other factors that cause poverty, such as education, are dependent upon family breakdown. they are not independent variables, and any statistical analysis that treats them as though they were independent will come up with flawed results.    there is another problem. even if iceland is correct that out of wedlock childbirths do not cause poverty, the research of sara mclanahan and gary sandefur in their landmark book 'growing up with a single parent' documents the fact that children of single mothers are more likely to drop out of school, abuse drugs, suffer from depression or low self-esteem, have lower lifetime earnings, and are more likely to have out of wedlock children themselves. furthermore, only about half of this gap can be attributed to poverty itself. fatherlessness is an independent contributing factor.    i would instead recommend that interested readers check out 'the new world of welfare' edited by rebecca blanks and ron haskins. it is a bipartisan collection of essays on welfare and poverty representing the left and right. it is interesting that none of the ""liberal"" contributors disagreed with the ""conservative"" claim that family breakdown is an important cause of poverty. and on the other side, none of the ""conservatives"" disagreed with the liberal claim that although welfare reform has been successful, there have been some women who are worse off. the liberal theory could be put this way: ""family breakdown is an important cause of poverty, but we need to find a way to both provide aid *and* fix the family."" the only differences are on policy prescriptions, not analysis. it is a refreshing bit of consensus in an otherwise acrimonious debate. i would also recommend 'civil rights' by thomas sowell and 'the marriage problem' by james wilson. misleading"	0
"the princess bride is one of my all-time favorites. it's incredibly funny and entertaining.   my main reason to write a review is to inform the general public that s. morgenstern is a narrating device used by william goldman: this is not an ""abridged"" book, every word was written by goldman. all hail goldman. so don't spend the rest of your life searching for the ""original""---this is it. the princess bride"	1
as someone new to martial arts but not to stretching, this book is a great resource. years of dance training taught me the importance of stretching but there was a lot i'd forgotten and some i'd never learned in the first place. it's so helpful to have the author explain, in plain english, how stretching works and why some exercises are successful while others are a waste of time. i also found the harder and easier variations for each exercise a big help in modifying some of the exercises to suit what i need as i work on my flexibility at home between classes. highly recommended for anyone looking to become more flexible or just stay in shape. well done and thorough	1
"i thought i was going to get a thriller when i first heard of this.  instead i got a pseudo-sequel to cold mountain set in 1980 texas, and i have rather low opinions of cold mountain.  it was difficult to follow the story due to mccarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move i've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing ""english"" or using ""livingroom"" instead of ""living room"" and ""mam"" instead of ""ma'am.""  i don't know if this is something mccarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable.  i also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of sheriff bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after  world war two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of delaware.  hopefully its movie adaptation (which i legitimately pity the coen brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible. too artsy for its own good"	2
"walt whitman's life's work is his ""leaves of grass"", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  regarded as america's poet, whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the ""manifest destiny"" ideology of the pre-war, through the reconstruction period of us history.      the poems are diverse and upbeat.  the language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  very few poetic devises are used.    one may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  but, in comparison to rhyhming verse by longfellow, frost, byron, browning, or shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.      although a classic, ""leaves of grass"" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  none of his poems are memorable.  not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.    i give two stars to the work, simply because i must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, ""dead poet's society""; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is. known as america's poet, whitman is not poetic"	2

really nice book for night and low light photografy. step by strep approach, great examples, really wonderfull photos. i think that it will make me a better photographer. the only thing is missing is one chapter for digital photography (to be honest i am a amateur photographer that i have shot only with sony cybershot f-717 and lately with nikon d70) but i give 5 stars because all the technics the author gives (apart from the ones related to film section) are applicable in the digital world as well. great book	1
"i checked out this book from the library for a history project, but i found the information and analysis in this book too biased for use on a research paper. this book is an attack on the clinton administration and communism, not a history book. the book fails to incorporate the current domestic and global conditions in china, and rely too heavily on common beliefs of the ""evils"" of the communist theory. of course, history has proven that communism is bad, but he fails to understand, there is a reason why the government in china is still in place today. the author fails to understand the thinking, history, and cultures of the chinese. in his suggestions of how the united states should act against china, the author makes a clear statement that the ends justify the means, and indirectly states that it's okay for the united states to be immoral to eliminate any competition. in a world where people constantly criticizes our arrogance and ignorance, his suggestions confirms the criticisms about how we believe we are the best, and everyone should follow our example without a true understanding of the situation.  ironically, we are the country that emphasizes diversity, but we are also the country who forces others to be just like us even though our model might not fit for their country. biased"	0
i was surprised when i took this class that i did not like this book.  all of my epid profs highly recommended this text.  you have to flip back and forth when you are doing the problems because they list the sas output that you need once in one chapter.  i know it saves space, but this can get maddening.  i did not find the examples clearly written at all-the lack of fit test, and some of the stuff about partial f tests could have used a few more sentences.      no, i cannot write a glowing review of the text, but the only reason for the second star is because i also had a terrible instructor for this course.  perhaps if dr. kleinbaum had taught this to me, i would have a different perspective of this book.  however, i was pretty much teaching myself this material, and this book is not designed for that. not that great	2
"in the reinvention of work, matthew fox brings together the work of eastern and western mystics, ancient, medieval, and modern, to propose a new paradigm for how we work and what we do. citing meister eckhart, thomas aquinas, hildegard von bingen, the bhagavad gita, tao te ching, studs terkel, patch adams, and progressive economists, fox explores the concept of work and how it can be healthier physically, emotionally, and intellectually, but primarily socially, environmentally, and spiritually.    fox believes that the enlightenment and the industrial age have left us with a machine-centered, anthropocentric world that focuses on outer work and rewards at the cost of inner work and spirituality, and destroys rather than creates. real wealth results from preserving the health of the planet, not in the artificiality of money or possessions. the result has been a world often at war, where the gaps between affluent and poor continue to spread, where the environmental health of non-industrialised nations is sacrificed for the comforts of the industrialised, and where the work that is available and that most people have serves machines and leaves the worker stressed, addicted to work, ill, angry and even violent, and unfulfilled intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually.    fox cites mystics like eckhart and aquinas to show that they understood what is important and that they prophetically understood the traps that man is prone to fall into. he also recounts the stories of people who reinvent themselves through work, who are willing to sacrifice position and possessions to find an avocation that matters, like the man who gives up a high-paying position to become a fireman and who is ecstatic about the meaning it brings to his life.    fox carefully sets up all that is wrong with our modern concept of work and, indeed, life, since so much of who we are, how we feel, and how we live is tied up in what we do for a living, or what we mistakenly call ""work."" his proposed solutions are centered around creation spirituality, which is a ""creation-centered mysticism that is also prophetic and socially transformative."" while creation spirituality is not very clearly defined here-fox has written several other books about it and refers to them-it appear to center around the idea that creation comes from within and that we create our world, which is part of a greater, interdependent cosmos that continues to undergo creation. for fox, ""enlightenment"" might mean recognising and embracing creation spirituality and our responsibility and role in the ongoing creation of the cosmos-a recognition that begins with inner work and extends outer work, and that redefines wealth and poverty. fox is quick to point out that this is neither communism nor socialism, both of which suffer from the same destructive values as capitalism.    there are many elements involved in creation spirituality, which embraces many aspects of life that have been neglected, distorted, or abused, from education, health care, art, psychology, and sexuality to something he believes is critical yet missing or misused-ritual. in creation spirituality and the reinvention of work, properly conceived and performed ritual is meaningful, bringing people together, bringing out emotions, and acknowledging what has been done in the name of war, destruction, and hate. ritual can also be playful and energising, for example, circle dances. whatever the focus, ritual brings us together to share our common joys and sorrows. ritual heals.    mysticism appeals to me, and fox's assessments of what's wrong and what could be done to change our course make sense and are supported by the quotes he provides from a  broad array of sources, including psychologists, economists, writers, and artists. the consequences of not changing are clear, but it is equally clear that those consequences have not penetrated to either the masses or their leaders. (even the rising price of gasoline in 2005 has not inspired any more than cautious apprehension.) we are like smokers who are able to quit our habit only when terminal lung cancer has been diagnosed.    to get billions of conditioned consumers (and their consumers-in-training children) to give up their increasingly complex lifestyles, comforts, and amusements in the interest of a healthier, more just world for all and for better personal mental and physical health requires a utopian change that most people will not embrace. as with the woolgers in their book, the goddess within, fox tries to find a movement in the mid-1990s that has not materialised yet. generally, people do not choose to change; they are forced to. perhaps someday, when the gaps have widened too far, and society and our home can no longer support our appetites (and the corresponding waste), we may be ready to listen to fox and his adherents, at which point they will need to provide practical answers. who will ""make ritual""? who will produce the necessities and how? who will distribute them? how will they be paid, or what will replace a monetary/barter economy? what if there is imbalance between what people want to do and what needs to be done? in practical, everyday terms, what does the reinvention of work look like? and do i want to live long enough to experience the disasters that are likely to be required to bring it about?    eckhart, aquinas, von bingen, the bhagavad gita, tao te ching-all wise beyond their times. and beyond ours as well.    diane l. schirf, 21 august 2005. personally appealing, largely impractical"	1
dave barry writes as though he were elmore leonard on speed.  it is hard to say exactly where the plot loses and contact with reality and possibility, but at the end you have to sit back and laugh and blow a sigh of satisfaction and relief that such things cannot happen, such people cannot actually exist.  quite.  like leonard, barry's characters get their motivations, a lot of them, from the draw of the illegal, the desire to make big quickly.  they are such strange people, each one perhaps, just, possible, and yet thrown together they interact in ways that could never be real.  and barry keeps the entire thing just teetering on the edge between hysteria and tragedy, leaving his readers poised to fall either way, and laughing the entire time, both from the absurd humour and from relief.  i don't know how many other books barry has since written, novels, i mean, not his humour columns (this was his debut fiction), but i shall have to read them and leave his newspaper offerings alone.  they, the columns, aren't even in the same realm, let alone league. barry outdoes his previous form	1
"this is the first book by deaver that i have read.  apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- i will never read them.    deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  he also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because i have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel i doubt the other books could be much better.  worse than deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  like many other second-drawer mystery writers, deaver portrays such notable organizations as the fbi, ins, us coast guard, and the nypd as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  this is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since deaver sets chinese/american economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.         a note to deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  it has been 115 years since doyle introduced the world to sherlock holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing doyle's character.  please try to be original.     and also, if the final ""twist"" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  i give this book a d. sinks like a stone, stinks like a monkey"	2

witch is a riveting read about a woman who undoubtedly killed at least two people - her mother and her former husband. she was never  charged in the death of her ex, and she skated several years until the stench from a storage shed where she stashed the body of her mother put authorities on her trail.  puit does a nice job of tracing the steps of brookey lee west, a tech writer/marble reader (she claims she can read the future using marbles)/daughter of a satan worshipper.  witch was a quick read - i usually take my time with books, but this tale was compelling enough that i hardly put it down. it is somewhat gorey in spots, but well worth reading if true crime is your thing. one whacked witch	2
"the problem with this book is that it was written as a textbook with very little practal advice and no real ""know-how"" methods.  similar to virtually all business books written by professors for colleges, this book falls very short in equipping would-be entrepreneurs with the insight, skills, and know-how needed to become successful entrepreneurs.  i would not waste your money on this book at any price.      if you want a great book on the topic, i highly recommend ""the startup company bible for entrepreneurs"".   this little-known book is rapidly becoming the standard for entrepreneurs. more like the portable associates degree in entrepreneurship"	0
i picked this book up in order to quickly get a better understanding of mormon history.  the bushmans rapidly cover lds history, but i was not satisfied with the depth of the material.  the book is pretty much a straight narrative with little attempt at interpretation or critical evaluation.  of course, the book is part of a series of religious history surveys for the general reader, so it is not too surprising that the bushmans do not go very deep.  nonetheless, at only 103 pages, they could have offered a little bit more meat to their treatment of lds history. the first half of the book dealing with early mormon history is the best, but far too uncritical.  (what ever happened to those golden plates revealed to joseph smith?)  the second half of the book starts to read like a tract put out by the church.  it has an almost apologetic tone.  when a controversial issue is broached, like mormon teaching about african americans, the authors handle it very delicately.  since the authors are both historians at columbia, i expected better.  it almost seems that the book was slapped together, especially at the end where the bushmans jump from topic to topic.  having said all of that, i did learn some things from this volume, but there has got to be a better introduction to mormon history out there.  for those interested in a more critical look at one event in mormon history, check out &quot;blood of the prophets&quot; by will bagley. short and shallow	2

i hoped to find a great amount of content from this catholic priest. i have long suffered the issues of guilt in the same religion and the fear of god was about being afraid of messing up in life rather than having a healthy fear of the lord.   father tom accurately describes that guilt issue. however, instead of expressing how he found the lord to be a forgiving god and that we are in need of accepting his grace, tom moves into a diatribe of panentheism and peppers most of the book with this type of theology that has proven inconsistent in and of itself. if you don't know, panentheism is a way of explaining that &#34;everything is in god&#34;. at the surface that sounds great. but there is more to it. it also ascribes that god is so intertwined in the creation that he cannot live apart from it. man. that is a leap...since god is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, and he was so before he made the earth.   ok&#62;..so you see. tom moves away from a real answer to the guilt issue to explain a theology that has no foundation in truth.   if you want the guilt answer...doooo noooott buy this book. instead, buy a bible. holman press just came out with a great one. read the first few verses of romans chapter 8. then buy a couple of great commentaries that discuss them. if you want the short answer. hear it is. &#34;we are not ever going to be good enough. and that is ok. god forgives all of us. just accept that fact.&#34; don't stop trying though. it helps others see the good in god when they see it. being good is not for going to heaven. it is to help show others that there is a good god to go to heaven to see!. guilt unexplained and more	0
that was the worst novel ever.  i didn't follow the story line at all.  it seemed so random, almost like there wasn't a story line at all.  i was soooo confused with the book because i didn't see any characters except some hydrogen, cobalt, and zinc oxide.  there were so many marraiges between hydrogen and carbons and other oddly named people.  i was revolted when reading that 2 hydrogens married an oxygen.  do not get this book.  it is possibly the worst story i have had the misfortune to read. wow! i fell asleep reading	0
"to all who have read this malarkey, and for those who intend to, i have a suggestion. first, read all the articles by tim callahan of skeptic magazine. he is an authentic scholar who specializes in debunking revisionism and bigotry. since he like mr. cahill is irish the 3-5 star reviewers will not be able to condemn him for being anti-irish. he makes certain, unlike cahill that he has a mountain of proof-evidence to verify his thesis. i was so impressed with his methods that it truly surprised me that some people actually fell for this book. in fact he used every point that the 1-2 star reviewers mentioned, and more. i agree with him that the entire ""hinges of history series"" largely lacks any in depth research. the first 3 chapters of this book is devoted to rehashing what most of us learned in grade school. the next 2 chapters are clearly the authors reinterpretations of the period. the rest of the book felt padded. what does plato have to do with the title, or premise? where are the footnotes and sources? that makes everything dubious at best. also, cahill did make archie bunker type remarks about other groups that have no place in our society, except in a very tasteless jokebook. read callahan first, or in place of this rusty fiction. rusty fiction."	0
the details of everyday life in a confederacy of dunces add up to a complex picture of new orleans in the early sixties.  we get a sense, as well, of the changes coming on a broader level:  the old world is passing away, and a new world is coming into being on the streets of the quarter.   critical theory students at louisiana state university are analyzing this text nine different ways, and finding a multitude of meanings.  they understand how new historical analysis proves especially delightful and insightful. new historical criticism	1

"a lot has already been said about this novel, so i'll address my review to those unfamiliar with mccarthy's work.  if you've never read mccarthy before, this is a great place to start.  the plot is tight, engaging, and easy to follow, and the language is gorgeous.  if you enjoy this book and want to move on to others, read the others in the border trilogy before tackling ""blood meridian.""      some people will take issue with mccarthy's grammar, sentence structure, use of spanish, and punctuation (or lack thereof).  mccarthy takes a lot of poetic license with his writing, and chooses words as much for their sound as for their meaning.  the sentences are written with attention paid to rhythm and ""breath,"" meaning that they don't always look or sound like conventional prose.  this will be displeasing to some.  as an example, the first line of the book reads:  ""the candleflame and the image of the candleflame caught in the pierglass twisted and righted when he entered the hall and again when he shut the door.""  now, mccarthy could have just as easily said ""the candle flickered when he entered the room,"" or something like that, but the effect, aurally, is just not the same.    read the first page of the book.  if you don't catch fire at the beauty of it, then maybe this book, and mccarthy's work in general, is not for you. the best mccarthy novel to read first"	1
"following is a 4 part review consisting of:   1) intro and recommendations    2) point location review    3) meridian review    4) action/indications review    1)  i am a first year acupuncture student at bastyr university.  we have been using this text as the primary book for our meridians and points class.  it is a good text (one of the best out there for point location), and it is always undergoing revisions (got to love an author dedicated to his subject).  i also recommend the flash cards as a quick reference (a lot easier to carry around) and trail guide to the body by andrew biel (isbn:0965853454) to supplement your education.    2)  a manual of acupuncture is strong on point location with good images to help with quick reference.  only a few discrepancies contained within the text.  deadman usually gives clear anatomical descriptions in the text that will get you even more precisely to the point than the picture.  there are a lot of quick ways to find a point, a few of them even work, luckily deadman stays away from most of them and chooses to give you good accurate descriptions that will be true all the time under normal circumstances.   -- pet peeve exception: li-4 location note gives an unclear description of using the ""bulge of the muscle"" to find the point.  this quick trick will have you needling in random directions in random places (some of them hurt!).  the refined version of this trick can actually be helpful... 1. passively adduct the patient's thumb so that it contacts the palmar surface of the index finger.  2. with the hand radial side up put your finger on the highest point of the bulge (this will be near the end of the crease).  3. release the thumb and let your finger sink down as the bulge disappears -- there you go!  after all, if you are using tricks on the major points of the body you need to make sure they work on most of the people most of the time; the rest of the time refer to deadman's excellent text.    3) meridians are given clearly with detailed text.  though our instructor subscribes to a slightly different theory for some of the fine points here and there, overall i have no complaints.  again, i love the illustrations in this book.    4)  basic actions are given, but without much explanation of the mechanism (thank you kyo for breaking that down); the long list of indications and a solid understanding of chinese medicine (or good instructor) will get you on your way to figuring out possible mechanisms.  once you understand the theory it will eliminate the confusion initially created by a long list of indications.  references are good, but you must always look beyond it an figure out why/for whom/under what conditions that prescription was written; otherwise you will be trapped by ancient dogma and modern conditions. lets get to the point"	1
eric hobsbawm, dedicated to applying the none too convincing idea of &quot;scientific&quot; marxism in its traditional petrie dish of history, wields the critic's pen more like a butcher's cleaver than the rapier with which he believes, a la don quixote, he is thrusting. so it falls upon this reviewer to stand in faithfully as hobsbawm's sancho panza. as such i appeal to you, eric, not to begin a work of historical analysis with an invocation to an intergalactic historian, for it is the most preposterous thing i have ever encountered. perhaps you were intrigued with the greeks' romantic, albeit &quot;unscientific,&quot; appeal to the muse for inspiration? how else can we, your faithful followers in the pursuit of truth, justice and the human way in the study of history, explain this unhistorical incantation? have courage, though! we know that your unwavering adherence to the &quot;scientific&quot; precepts of marxism will excuse everything. in short, eric, we know that you have been writing too much while watching star trek. eric, history is not supposed to be science fiction	0
like it or not, i sometimes wonder if an author is more loved for his image than his abilities.  thomas pynchon is one of those.  if the crying of lot 49 is his best work, or exemplary of his work, as so many say it is, then perhaps he really should find a day job, to use the cliche.  lot 49 is an attempt at literature without any actual literature.  it's what happens when you take out plot, character, and all the other devices that make up traditional story telling.  i am very well aware that, pynchon, like so many other authors of his era, are trying to prove that life in the modern world is soulless and meaningless.  the problem is, he is not looking hard enough to find it.  he is the literary equivalent of that cooky professor who says nothing written after 1900 is worth reading.  my answer to the professor who tried to shove that one down my throat was to hand him a dozen books worth reading that were written in the last century.  the problem is, you have to look hard to find the gems in the dross of life, and this book simply tells you that those don't exist.  finally, the content of the book often seems pointless, and the writing is weak.  there is no forward motion, and nothing to interest a decent reader. over blown	0
"i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara's pulitzer prize winning ""killer angels,"" and because i'm a baseball fan.  the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  it's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  the feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.    any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  shaara sets most of the novel in yankee stadium with the hawks playing the yankees.  why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  the hawks apparently are from atlanta, but an atlanta team, braves or hawks, whichever, would not be playing the yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in yankee stadium--not on the mound on the field.    this book was published posthumously and mr. shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in ""killer angels.""  it's unfortunate.    there are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book. nothing special here"	2
nansook hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to hyojin moon, but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents' machinations to get her married into the moon family. eyewitnesses tell of nansook visiting the moon household and knowing full well of hyojin's excesses in advance of her marriage. the hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the moon family, and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first moon daughter, they pushed nansook to marry a moon son. though i don't know all the motives, the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that ms. hong has not been honest about. it is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of rev moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect, given her own deceit. not quite what it seems	2
the book begins with huffington complaining that her cable bill has just gone up while the ceo of her cable company just got a fat raise. poor huffington, the victim of ruthless greedy ceo's. here's  an idea arianna, dump cable and sign up with dish network or voom or directtv, or just cancel service altogether, its just cable tv not oxygen. she really doesn't discuss the fact that there are such alternatives. why are there so many alternatives to those meanies at the cable company? because of deregulation which she bemoans as the source of all the worlds troubles in the first place. this sort of nutty reasoning is used throughout the entire book. if youre an angry lefty by all means buy this book. if you want to learn somthing, don't waste your money. good for a laugh	0

"if you like to explore provocative ideas, then you will enjoy biocosm.  gardner begins by arguing that a strong version of the anthropic principal is required to account for the goodness of fit between the physical parameters of our current universe, and the parameters required for the evolution of intelligent life.  he builds on lee smolin?s hypothesis (the life of the cosmos) that our current universe is the product of a long evolutionary history that has favored universes that could produce baby universes (in the form of black holes) and these same parameters are also favorable for intelligent life.  gardner points out (correctly) that smolin's hypothesis does not explain how such baby universes inherit the parameters of their mothers, and then offers a provocative solution.  it is our future intelligent progeny that program the physical laws into future universes (as they have in the past).  this is gardner's selfish biocosm hypothesis (sb).  gardner rejects linde's ""eternal chaotic inflation"" plus a weak version of the anthropic principal (eci&wa) but it appears to me that gardner needs linde's idea to produce the first universe with intelligent life.  after that, sb might work.  however, if eci&wa is needed to get sb off the ground, then sb is no longer useful, since eci&wa alone can account for the apparent goodness of fit between the parameters of the physical universe and the parameters necessary for intelligent life.  despite my concerns, i believe gardner's book is worth reading because it addresses some of the critical issues and constraints that confront any acceptable theory of cosmic origins. universal darwinism?"	2
"if you have had to take out a mortgage to buy a house, have ever purchased life insurance or have a retirement account, this book will seem extremely basic. there aren't really any tools, worksheets or practical plans here. the book is simply a series of ""tips"" -- very brief articles from different financial planners. it's a readable format, but there's not much meat.    for example, the section on ""software for staying organized"" includes mention of only 3 software products, two of which are microsoft money and intuit quicken. the author starts her comments saying ""the basic/standard versions are entry-level products designed for people new to personal finance software"" (my experience with the basic versions of those programs is that they include quite powerful analysis and budgeting tools).      if you're just starting out or really need a primer, this is a readable book and comes well recommended. but if you are reasonably literate in working with lenders and insurance companies, you'll find this too simple. very very basic information"	2
rated three stars only because it was not as extensive as advertised. this is an introduction to the pimsleur method. it gives you a rudimentary sense of the spanish language, and not much else. if, however, your interest is in the pimsleur method and you want a good sample, this is it. a nice marketing tool! i will be ordering the pimsleur method as a result of this teaser, so i guess it works as intended. nice introduction to the language	2
"flip the switch is an excellent book.  i'm 29 and tired of being overweight.  i bought this book months ago.  i read half of it, then moved from seattle to valdez, alaska.  all the while i was moving, i could not stop thinking about this book.  as soon as my shipment arrived, i found the book asap and finished it.      i have seen that some complain about the resistance products he promotes in his books.  i look at it this way:  spend a ton of money on a gym membership or spend around $10.00 for a resistance rope - plus - you get to do this in the privacy of your home.  this is a great idea, especially for women that have children, a job and the home to contend with.      jim karas was overweight for several years.  he can relate to me.  he revels on the fact that resistance training is the way to go and thank goodness because i simply cannot handle cardio workouts due to a bad back.  the running and ""stepping"" in cardio is too much for me.      this is a great book for anyone but women will especially appreciate the convenience. flip it!!!  ...........  flip it good!"	1
frankly, sex magick is much simpler than this book would have us believe.  masturbate to enter an altered state of consciousness over a sigil.  have extended periods of sex to accomplish the same goal.  simple, no?  and, guess what?  that's all this book says, as practical information goes.  the rest is conjecture, faulty history or useless anecdote specifically there to make you impressed. more complicated than it needs to be	0
"there are two types of writers...one writes to inform the reader, the other writes to try to impress other writers.  mr. reese tried the latter, but didn't acomplish either.  reading this book is like trying to understand a sloppy drunk stranger explaining why his wife left him....it doesn't make sense and it's b-o-r-i-n-g.   it's ironic that a frenchman with a german mother, who also spent wwii in the german army on the eastern front and who never claimed to be a writer (guy sajer), wrote the book that is everything that reese's book wanted to be, and isn't.  if you are looking for the ultimate ""can't put it down"" memoir of a soldier that brings home the horrors of war along with humanity at it's best and worst, get ""forgotten soldier"" by guy sager.   like coke, it's the real thing. gave it one star because i couldn't give it zero"	0
this is a book that you'll read over and over. you'll dog ear the pages and turn them yellow with highlighter. there is pure gold to be mined on every page.    what makes this book so valuable is the science behind persuasion that mr. hogan explains in easy to understand language. you walk away with a real understanding of how to persuade and why it works. in fact, i found the chapter on the impact of non-verbal communication to be worth the whole price of the book and even more. after i read this book, i was surprised it wasn't priced in the $80 range like many of the other persuasion books.    this book should be considered a primer for everyone who wants to seriously persuade. get it, read it, use it, persuade, profit. this book is a must read if you want to deeply understand persuasion	1
this is an incredible true story of a man passionate to reach for christ those who have never heard. it also clearly illustrates the darkness, evil and despair that comes from idolatry. but it also shows the true liberation and freedom that can come only for christ. this book will draw you in from the first page.     the world needs more people like stan. people who are willing to trust solely in god and how are willing to go to dangerous remote areas to share christ. this book will shatter your complaceny and force you to think. i highly recommend this book. for all christians, but especially those (like me) who have  heart for missions. this book details the good, the bad, and the ugly of missions work. powerful 	1
"i got strange looks when people spotted me reading war and peace. not many 14 year olds took on the challenge. yet i did, and enjoyed myself immensely. if you read it in a public place, you'll most likely get funny looks for reading the very complicated unabridged book. and i can assure you that you will most likely enjoy yourself almost as much as i did.    ""war and peace"" tells of many different characters, goes through their lives, and describes the very complicated connections they all have with each other. it is a huge book, and for the first two hundred pages, one can't even tell someone what the book is ""about"", because it's not quite clear.  but then it does become clear, and it all starts making wonderful sense. you can't help but fall in love with some of the characters and the way they act, because they're such special characters, and it feels as though you truly know them.  despite its length, this book is totally worth it; worth the time, the effort, the headaches, the angry mutterings about things not going your way... it's worth everything. war and peace"	1
the lilting prose and alternating black-and-white and colorful illustrations make this one of my favorite books to read to my little one.  there is a reason this book is a classic. a lovely book	1
book #23 in the in death series.  this book had the potential to be the best in the series.  but eve's ever increasing sensitivity issues made ruined it's perfection.  as the swisher family is brutally murdered in their sleep, their is a lone survivor and witness, their young daughter nixie.  in the beginning eve embraces the child reluctantly when she finds her in the home hiding.  you feel eve can relate to her terror.  then when eve brings the child into her home to protect her, she does everything she can to alienate the kid.  come on!  i thought eve was growing and then she takes a giant leap back.  it was just a little to over the top for me.  too much lack of compassion.  thank goodness for raorke and sommerset.  the mystery is top notch, and peabody is back on the job.    i just wish eve would take some sensitivity classes.  other than that another excellent book. oh, eve!	2
"the ""bird flu preparedness planner"" delivers what it promises in a clear, compelling, straight-forward way. dr. woodsen lays out the facts of this health threat with no hype and no panic. however, it is real, it is deadly, and it is heading our way.    the most valuable feature of this slim, easy-to-read manual, is its simplicity and practicality for preparedness. it has checklists of supplies, medicines, and food a family would need in case of a severe epidemic or pandemic. i will try to get tamiflu (to help with ordinary strains of influenza) and the over-the-counter remedies he recommends.    i think the food list could have been a bit more comprehensive. i plan to have more than rice and potatoes on hand to feed a family of six for eight weeks. however my grocery list looks more like a summer cookout for a family reunion than an emergency stash. i suppose 8 cases of baked beans and 8 summer sausages is a little over-the-top. simple. straight-forward. practical. helpful."	2
a wonderful book for teaching a coping strategy to a child with an autism spectrum disorder when s/he feels overwhelmed, stressed or angry. excellent book for asd kids	1
"the third secret is another entry in the vatican intrigue genre. it has the usual elements: vatican conservatives the usual bad guys vs liberal catholics the usual good guys. the ""third secret"" refers to secret revelations given to marian visionaries at such places as fatima and medjugorge, the existence of which is historical fact. if there is any suspense in the novel, it is not with the plot which is remarkably predictable and derivative. the only thing that kept my interest was waiting to find out the actual content of the third secret(s), at least according to the novel's author. in the end, these proved to be rather predictable too, given the author's religious inclinations. the third secret: a novel of (not that much) suspense"	2
"walter mosley's ""easy rawlins"" series is well plotted, the characters are well thought out, and the stories are very original. i am a fan of his new ""fearless jones"" series, which does a lot to  explain racism in 1950s los angeles.    nothing i've read about walter mosley explains why he would want to write this piece of trite.  this book is the worst rehash of bad 1950s sci-fi movies that i've read in years.  i've been reading sci-fi for forty years and this is about as bad as it gets.  the story is totally trash, you know the ending before you get past the beginning, the characters are ridiculous, and the sex scenes are even worse (hard to ruin sex, but he does it).      if this was by anyone else it never would have gotten published. it would be a favor to him and all his fans to buy back every copy that exists and bury them. rehash of a second rate sci-fi horror movie"	2
this is the story of cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young indian policeman who just arrived in la. cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.    this is by far the most disappointing of picoult's books, and i've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. the story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.    i was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. what is frustrating is that it takes picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.    i also found cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband alex, a massive egocentric. the story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in africa, with anthropology, indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.     if you want a superb story of domestic violence, read black & blue by anna quindlen. if you want a good picoult book, read the pact or my sister's keeper, but definitely not picture perfect. very disappointing	2
this great little book is full of easy juicing recipes. another good thing about this book is that jay goes into detail about the vast, enormous benefits of a raw foods vegan diet. i am not a raw foodist, but as a vegan it is wonderful that jay informs people who buy this book who may not be vegan the simple fact that one can easily get calcium from other sources than cows milk. i have had a juicer for two years and still refer back to this book from time to time. a must have	1

this novel is comprised of pretty, well constructed sentences.  that's about all it is.  pretty, well constructed sentences.  the story itself could be interesting, after all it is a tale of multi-generational abandonment but it is told so dispassionately that it was difficult to remain interested, let alone awake.  the narrator, although the main character, was so far removed, emotionally, from her own telling of the story, that you wondered why she had bothered.      at time it seems that the writer was so enthralled with her own use of language that she seemed to forget that there was a story that needed to be told. pretty language but couldn't stay awake	2
i find it disturbing that john updike can apparently find no female artist worthy of mention in his book...beyond one artist who is practically unknown. and she is included only because his family owned a piece of artwork created by her. updike seems very dismissive of even this one female contributor.    he does find room in his book to include a nude photo of the great artist georgia o'keefe, but no actual artwork created by o'keeffe. that should give you a clue what the rest of the book is like.     disturbing, too, are updike's dismissive comments about edward hopper; he claims that edward hopper can't paint faces very well.      so even though i purchased this book, i don't recommend it to others. give this one a pass. why does updike ignore women artists? 	2
"my dad bought me this wonderful little book when i was young, & i have always loved the truly off-center humor of it. in response to the query about the meaning of epiplectic, i found a quick online search produced the same type of results as reviewer rhs got--mostly references to epileptic & apoplectic. oddly, i have a clear memory of looking it up decades ago (one of my father's favorite admonitions was ""look it up!"") and finding a definition that related it to apoplectic, and described it as referring to something that suddenly and somewhat violently falls to pieces. in fact i have often cited 'epiplectic' as an apt description when watching the blues brothers' faithful retired police car burst into bits once they make daley plaza, lol--so this definition, though unconfirmable at the moment, has been clearly emblazoned in my memory for these many years (right or not)! now if i could just find that dictionary of my dad's to confirm.. meaning of epiplectic"	1
"the successful companies are not afraid to confront the problem when it arises and discuss it rationally.    even though directed more toward a business or office atmosphere, the same techniques can be applied  to family and friends.  the example stories cover a broad array of possible circumstances, which will help when conversations turn crucial (or critical).   the chapters flow well, with a touch of humor.  the skills can be easily learned.  chapters 1-2 are an introduction; chapters 3-9 details how to use each skill;  chapters 10-12 is a summary and contains advanced study tools.    the authors believe good communication skills (talking, listening and acting together) start with the heart.  to some these skills may seam obvious, but they are also meant to boost or to rid ourselves of years of bad habits.  they will then become more conscience as practiced.    first is to recognize we need this book.  then we need to utilize it and build our communication skills to make them habits.  i believe it is safe to say that most who pick this book up will come away with an improvement in some area.

"...because i thought white oleandar was brilliant. but this book? not so much. i would not be surprised if paint it black were something fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. it felt much less fully realized. i found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. i generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. the whole book was written in one note, so i, too, agree with the ""flat"" description. i found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. i absolutely savored every word of fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it. i wanted to like this book so badly..."	0

de soto's work was viewed by economists, historians, and politicians alike as breakthrough.  he gives us an in-depth look at the lima's informal sector and postulates, much to the satisfaction of his washington, d.c.  bankroll, that peruvians are bursting to embrace democracy and market  capitalism.  unfortunately, he has twisted peru's real scenario to reflect  what washington wants to hear.  in reality, lima's informal sector is  merely a way for a depraved population to survive, not a radical shift  toward capitalism.  de soto's institue for liberty and democracy was funded  almost in full by washington, and the man himself has spent more time in  the u.s. than in peru.  this book leans more toward american propaganda  than objective analysis.  an interesting read, but only with abundant  grains of salt. he almost had me convinced.	2
i bought this book based on its rating. unfortunately, virtually every page of this book is half blank. furthermore, there are many unnecessary blank lines within the text page. the format of this book is like for third grade. also, the author uses java code along with his text. but at the end of each chapter, he uses c++ code as a duplication of the java code.      if you want to know and learn design patterns, make sure you look at &quot;software architecture design patterns in java&quot; by partha kuchana. this book covers 42 design patterns including the 23 gof patterns. also, you might like to look at &quot;core j2ee patterns&quot; second edition by alur, crupi, amd malks. i'm returning this book	0

"i love the little jibe provided within the title of hernando de soto's ""the other path.""  it's a poke at ""the shining path"" (sendero luminoso), the maoist peruvian terrorist organization that wreaked havoc on de soto's homeland beginning in 1980.  de soto's attempt in this book is to show that the more effective struggle is to make capitalism more efficient.  to those who know de soto's work, the solutions are well known: build a system of laws that allow one's residents to buy, sell and value property rights; and reduce the complexities and banalities of starting a business.    if you've read de soto's master work ""the mystery of capitalism,"" then there is no new news here.  in fact, ""the other path"" will look out-of-date with its yellowing statistics.  so why the five stars?  as a testament to de soto's bravery.  think about the guts it took for him to research and publish this book in peru during the tumultuous and frightening period there.  what a statement. where de soto started - a brave statement"	1

this is an autobiography that describes how saadat decided to come to the knesset in the interests of egypt and the middle east. from fighting the british colonialism, arab corruption,  to egyptian nationalism.  a must for those who want to understand the new middle east  after ww2. also recommend his wifes book that came out after  one of the most tragic assasinations in recent history. anwar el-sadat on the road to jerusalem.	1
by anyone's standars, the cmdt annuals have to be considered among the best in the business, and for several reasons.     first, the annual review cycle keeps them up to date.     second the fact that this is now the 46th edition means that they have had plenty of time to work out the details as to what to include and how to find it.     third, each major section is written by specialists in that particular area, specialists who have worked in that area, and on this book for years.     fourth is the size. the new edition is almost 2,000 pages long. it covers just about everything an internal medicine specialist is supposed to know.     fifth, cdmt on-line which includes the entire book, plus several thousand addional pages, 1200+ images, drug information, patient handouts and much more.     sixth, for such a book, this one is surprisingly inexpensive.     all in all, this is the book by which others are compared. a standard of the profession	1

the death of the new economy has been greatly exaggerated. that's the message at the heart of sandra vandermerwe's new book. while the heady valuations of the late `90s are history, the fundamental changes that technology inspired during that time are here to stay. with that in mind, vandermerwe presents analyses of tools that business leaders need to survive into the 21st century. the most insightful of these is a breakdown of customer feedback loops and how they can be harnessed to lock in business. the book can't avoid many of the shortcomings that pervade most new economy literature, like the tendency to advise readers to remake their businesses in anticipation of future customer needs - without commenting on how exactly that can be achieved. nevertheless, if you're a manager who suspects that the innovations of the last decade might still play a key role in the growth of business, we [...] recommend this book to you. insightful!	2
this guide to culinary careers is terribly overpriced for the information it contains. the quick descriptions of different culinary careers have some value, as do the appendices listing culinary publications and organizations. however, the career descriptions are quite short and the advice is unremarkable. on the topic of finding a culinary mentor, for example, the author advises you to find one. that's pretty much it - no discussion on how to choose a suitable mentor, or how to convince an experienced professional to take you on as a protege. the book mentions the apprenticeship system but doesn't explain how to find an apprenticeship. the section on choosing a culinary school/vocational program is much better, though.    something trumpeted in both the book description here and on both covers of the actual book is the inclusion of up-to-date information on salary statistics and earning potential for the spectrum of culinary professionals. it must have been printed in invisible ink, because i don't see it *anywhere* (and yes, i have this exact edition). this promise was my primary motivation for getting the book, so i was very disappointed (disgruntled, even) that this information is not in the book after all.    don't spend money on this book unless you're just looking for a quick overview of the career possibilities. that's the one thing the author does well - it describes (in brief) a wide range of culinary careers beyond the obvious white-linen restaurant ones.    this book could have been greatly improved if it had expanded on the career descriptions, perhaps including short interviews with actual culinary professionals, especially those in roles like institutional cooking or food research. of course it also would have been much better if it had actually included the promised salary information, too.    it's a good book to have in a library or career center, but it's not much use for your home reference bookshelf. lightweight and disappointing	2
timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. it's an indulgent bit of junk food.  timeline starts with a hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of new mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters.  there are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. the story is ever-predictable and ludicrous.  but, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry.  go back and read andromeda strain. readalbe but junky	2
"i bought the moosewood restaurant low-fat favorites cookbook by the moosewood collective and put out by clarkson potter publishers in 1996, because i'd heard that this was a famous vegetarian restaurant chain with great food, and knew about it since the ""headquarters"" restaurant is located in ithaca, new york, where i went to school.      at first, the recipes, such as mushroom polenta pie, looked pretty good to me and not too hard to make, but beyond that, i found that a great deal of asian-inspired recipes, including five spice rice and lentil sambar were too exotic and complicated to make for my taste, and the costly ingredients for various dinner recipes were often hard to find at my non-upscale, local grocery store.  though i liked moosewood's recipe for ""oven fries,"" i could have easily gotten that off the internet.      and many moosewood recipes just started looking time-consuming.  have i really wanted to make complicated tunisian potato turnovers involving no less than 14 ingredients for my dinner on any weekday?  not really.  the curried sweet potato roti recipe needs 19 ingredients and the tamale pie asks for an astounding 26.      so, on the whole, i was disappointed with this book.  though i'm sure the restaurant food is pretty tasty because moosewood shows it knows how to flavor vegetables in innovative ways, i don't recommend this book to people who need simple tasty, vegetable meals on a daily basis while on the go.  this book might be more useful for entertaining guests on weekends, when you have more time and are feeling more adventurous. impressive, but not useful"	0
i purchased this book as a good primer for entering banking (specifically indymac bank).  when i joined retail banking (previously only having worked in investment banking at morgan stanley) i was able to expand my knowledge on various areas of the retail banking beyond just what i-banking had taught (e.g.,, valuation, sec ii & sec iii stat techniques, tax implications and flippying and insider trading tips of how to find/negotiate the best properties).      i would highly recommend this book to others in this field.    - jameson thottam. insightful review - by jameson thottam	1

"it does not seem that thomas pauley is particularly rich.  one of his best success stories is getting a good loan rate so he could buy a used mercedes that had 55,000 miles on it.   that's rich?!  it seems that if he were ""rich beyond his wildest dream"" he would pay cash for for any new car available and not think twice about it.  there is also a fair amount of nutty ideas like ""if most of the world believed in fairies, unicorns and mermaids, you would see them running around all of time.""  one of the most objectionable ideas is his concept of tithing.  he makes god out to be some sort of cosmic accountant that will strike back at you is he does not get his 10%. additionally mr. pauley's concept of tithing is very specific. according to mr. pauley giving to a church or charity is not tithing. giving 10% to a rock star because you are inspired by his lyrics is fine (as in the case of his son).  if fact he would say that giving to poor people would be ""foolish spending"".  you should tith to your spiritual source. i get the distinct impression that he wants me to kick back 10% to him.    there are a few good ideas like make lists and get specific about your goals but it is never followed up by an action plan.  you should just put in your order and wait for the universe to fill it.  mr pauley covers himself with a hugh loophole which is, if this system didn't work for you it means that the universe didn't want you to have it.    i suggest napolin hill's ""think and grow rich""  instead. are the authors qualified to write this book?"	0

"having read (and thoroughly enjoyed) levitt's freakonomics, i picked up ""hidden order: the economics of everyday life"" looking for more of the same. unfortunately, i was sadly disappointed.     i get the impression the author intended to write a freakonomics-type book, but was only able to come up with 40 pages of material (located at the end of the book). facing an irate publisher, he then filled in the initial 290 pages with his old economics lecture notes. as a result, readers who have taken an elementary economics course will find much of the material repetitive, while those who have not will most likely find the material too confusing to be of any real use. (despite the glowing accolades on the cover, the author's explanations are no better than those available in a standard textbook.)    the author also posits end-of-chapter questions for the reader to ruminate upon, but does not provide any answers. aside from formal textbooks where such questions are intended to be assigned to students, such tactics are unconscionable. of course, the author may be priming the pump for sales of a ""hidden order supplement"".    a final negative point is the author's tone, which is frequently condescending towards the reader (e.g. telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory, so it will not even be presented). while this may be true for a layperson reading the book, being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the subject matter.    overall, if you can borrow a copy from a friend or a library, the last 40 pages are worth reading. otherwise, save your time and money.    reviewer's background:  b.sc.

economist joseph a. schumpeter's keen intellect makes some of today's scholarship sound like the spouting of ideology on talk shows. some consider him the greatest economist of the twentieth century. only an intellect of his towering stature would be able to present a case that while marx was wrong about how capitalism would collapse, he was probably correct that it eventually would. schumpeter also contends that socialism may eclipse free-market economies, news he feels society should greet with angst. he believed that capitalism's doom would proceed not from a revolution by an angry proletariat, but rather as a result of successes that would give rise to a class of elites who would gradually institute systems of central control. fully understanding this complex, although non-mathematical, treatise may require some background; it is not a book for the novice. while this 1942 classic may seem dated in spots, those who conclude that it is time to tap dance on socialism's grave should consider that schumpeter expected socialism's dominance to take a century or more. we recommend this classic to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the historic, economic case for the rise of socialism. packed with knowledge !	1
"books of political position ought be fact ridden.  they should move you to the author's point of view, if not the author's conclusions, by marshalling facts first; then an author can supply analysis constrained by supplied facts.  only then should we be given some further speculation, unless moving directly to reasoned conclusions.    mr. horowitz does none.  instead he starves us for facts.  he substitutes instead only editorial cant.  i can conclude only that he aspires to persuade no one.  the audience is not the inquiring, the undecided or the doubting.      for example, he contrasts, on the first page the iraq war as ""so successful in its results."",  with the vietnam conflict as an unsatisfactory result -- renaming in the process what we thought to be a war.    mr. horowitz insists on weapons of mass destruction in iraq.  he states explicitly and blanketly that the execution of american power is a bulwark of national security.  he insists that american presidents have been either the toys or the allies of terrorists.  i kept waiting for evidence of any kind.  he even says the twin towers were destroyed in only minutes, yet were more important than pearl harbor.  my guess is that ww ii was not so cheap or unworthy.  neither were the more than sixty boys from my high school killed in the world trade center; at least i can reference time magazine as the source.  mr horowitz cheapens their deaths by saying it was the work of democrats allied with moslems in their struggle with the neo-conservatives whose birthright is the unfettered use of american soldiers and guards.      mr. horowitz has plenty of notes of a sort.  many are only self-referential as opposed to supportive from other sources.  he quotes the new york review of books, but leaves out words he does not like.  oddly he describes 9/11 as putting the bush administration ""on the run"".  he probably meant something else, but is simply incapable of precision and accuracy in general.  i cannot even recommend the book to those who oppose his purposes because they are so incoherently hysterical. this book should instruct you on the tactics of the subservise opponents of democracy"	0
"i recently borrowed this as an audiobook from the library because i need something to occupy my mind while i scan microfiche at work (boooorrring). i actually haven't finished this book yet, but up until what i listened to tonight, i hadn't made my mind up yet on how i felt about it. i was going to see it though, but now i'm not sure if i will.    i don't even know where to start about what i don't like about this book.    before starting this book, ms. picoult should have spent a little more time researching laws and procedure regarding kidnappings, especially proceedings following such a great span of time. i'll be the first to admit that i don't know much about law, but it seems quite unrealistic that delia's father andrew hopkins (or should i say charles matthews?) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week. i find it hard to believe that on his first day, he would get beaten and practically raped (i can't remember if he was or not). i could be wrong, but if 28 years have passed, wouldn't the statute of limitations passed, and even if they hadn't, wouldn't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen? and wouldn't it mean something that they were in a different state?    now, even though everyone else seemed to love her, delia was incredibly annoying (and the actress who read her ""monologues"" in the audio version was equally annoying). women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her. i have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men, but rarely ever do. it just seems like a fantasy of picoults, and a very boring one at that. ah, a love triangle, gee, like that's never been done before. one instance that sticks out is when delia gets upset that eric (her fiancee and her fathers attorney) doesn't tell her about a court appearing, however, eric didn't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen. but, even the premise for that is questionable: would that really happen? i mean seriously!    i also hated how the book shifted ""voices"" -- this is not a play, i don't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective. i didn't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters. i half expected a chapter to be from sophie (delia's four year old daughter) perspective. i could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore. i also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense, and then later incorporated into the passage, also not making sense. for example, eric narrates this dream he had about sondra, who is some beautiful girl he imagined. she turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush. later, ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up. somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit, when really they have no cohesive connection. also, between the three childhood friends (delia, eric and fitz) they talk about their memories constantly, as if that is the only thing that binds them together. real friendships don't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past... but it does in this book, because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends. to me, it just seems pretentious.    what's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all. one passage i remember is when delia is talking to fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born, and maybe they remember things that never happened to them. i might have that a little wrong, because it's a bit confusing. it's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense. it doesn't even feel like it's remotely trying to make sense at all! the book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual, like picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical.    all of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases. delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was four years old. for goodness sakes woman, i have maybe 2 or 3 memories from when i was four years old or younger, and most of them don't make sense except for the fact that i know what my parents have told me. by the way she acts, you'd think she was 12 when she was kidnapped.  also, she seems to recover memories all the time... man, i wish i could do that. it just seems a bit implausible, that's all.    the book is saturated in gooey, sappy imagery, metaphors, anecdotes, memories, subplots, and so on. i am not so quick to totally bash an author, but it's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that i loathe. if i wanted some sappy, melodramatic dimestore paperback i would have read one of those instead. i expected better from the synopsis on the back cover. overall, and i say overall without even finishing the book (i haven't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet, but it sounds pretty ridiculous), that this is definitely one of the most horrible books i've ever read, bar none. do yourself a favor and skip this one... and definitely don't pick up the audiobook. the voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to. if i could choose 0 stars, i would.

another in james d. doss' shaman series which began with the shaman sings in the mid 1990s. the series started off good and just keeps getting better. doss marries a wry writing style with well-drawn characters, a clever story line and a fine understated humour. his setting is southern colorado, a land of ranchers, wide spaces and capable country people both matukach (white) and ute native americans.     the shaman of the series, wise old ute daisy perika, doesn't feature to the extent that she has in other books in the series but her contribution via dreams and premonitions is subtle and true. her character is the stuff the series is built on. she is abrasive and annoying, and takes pleasure in being so, yet the writer has made her irascible while  likeable and she is the character the reader will remember long after the rest are forgotten.     the story's central character is charlie moon, nephew of daisy perika and a ute rancher and sometime policeman for his tribe. charlie's major trouble in life is a mountain cat terrorising his ranch workers and cattle, until he is asked to find out who injured a u.s. senator and at the same time killed billy smoke, the senator's driver. the senator, who runs the neighbouring ranch, has his own agenda and charlie finds himself also involved in investigating a leak of damaging government information from the senator's ranch.    charlie finds himself often on the tricky side of guns and dangerous animals (both human and not). it makes for a rollicking and thoroughly enjoyable read.     no sex but some violence. doss writes another winner in his shaman series	1
not only useful for the &quot;serious adult&quot; improv artist--as a drama teacher who works with underprivileged kids i find this the best book out there for helping them develop a sense of &quot;mastery&quot; on stage, a drama more alive to them than memorizing lines.  recommended for anyone who works with young actors. great for teachers of drama too!	1
k.m. soehnlein did not strike a single false note for me in his coming-of-age novel. the non-linear nature of many conversations (which still communicate much to both the listeners and the speakers), the guilt and excitement that a person feels when he continues to experience life during tragic circumstances, the way a series of bold decisions suddenly add up to a life spinning wildly out of control: all of these ring true to me.    the protagonist robin mckenzie is destined for greater things than his suburban new jersey town can give him -- he's smart, creative, and hungry -- but we're lucky to have a peak into the half-year when his life and identity are transformed (unfortunately, by an accident when childhood teasing gets out-of-hand).     the book is written for adults, although older teenagers might be ready for it. i imagine that some high school gays will dog-ear certain hot sections for re-reading. i would have done so had i stumbled on such a book when i was in high school. wait, i did ...    **spoiler**    and for once in recent fiction, a gay relationship in high school is shown to be the intoxicating, confusing, educational and finite experience that it often is.     i look forward to reading more from k.m. soehnlein. not a single false note in coming-of-age novel	1
"to compose a book set in a particular nation when you yourself belongs to a different country,it's forever going to be an issue of debate on whether your interptretation of the culture is authentic or not. then again,your own comprehension of the nation is put under a cloud. and reliability of your understanding is a major factor. thus a novel which transcends the national boundaries and cultural restrictions is always a rare item of literature in an equally scantily elemented realm of art but pearl sydenssstricker buck's pulitzer prize winning book ""the good earth"" set against the backdrop of a china for which the 20th. century revolution were distant rumblings of the dim future. this is a timeless,evergreen classic dressed in a transparent,empathic language and a finely woven plot which conspire to guise  this dark story in a lighter hue.    wang lung is a mediocre farmer ploughing his life through difficult times in kiangsu and around him ""the good earth"" revolves. pearl s. buck might be an american but in her adroit tracing of the trajectory of wang lung's life across a vast sky of deceitful times in china,the reader fathoms the mark of a gifted writer who has come to spearhead american literature. the authoress etches a great picture of wang lung and the plethora of incidents which provide testimony to him being led on by life's waves. wang lung marries a slave from the house of hwangs,o-lan,and along with her undergoes umpteen adventures and misadventures in life and witnesses its numerous dimensions.    ove a period spanning a lifetime,wang lung and o-lan travel to and fro the dual extermities of knee-deep poverty and exotic richness and therein eflect changes in character. the farmer and his wife along with their three sons and two daughters suffer abject povety when their village is cursed by drought and famine in such a degree that they're reduced to consuming even their ox. in search of better prospects,the protagonist takes his family to town where beggary is the sole mean to make both ends meet.    in anhwei,wang lung confronts bleak situations and finds himself nothing short of a foreigner in his own country,amidst his compatiots. lung fathoms a thick delineation between the rich and the poor and finds his own rustic background a crippling factor for him to blend with the townsfolks. this is a plight that is not only shared by other villagemen who've taken compatible measures as lung to earn their living in the town but also by uncountable such uneducated masses around the world in all ages who flock to a different landscape in hunt for better scope and in this symbolism abodes the book's universal appeal.    wang lung's adventures in town get him enough money and when he returns to his home village,he's already a prospering man. he buys land and cultivates myriad crops on them and gradually steps up the ladder of success and ultimately reaches the pinnacle when he and his large and everbranching family start residing in the house of hwang,the symbol of traditional landlords. but his monetary success comes at the cost of his moral notions as wang lung's conscience,despite sustaining honesty throughout,gets absorbed in preposterous wealthy,aristrocatic fashions. lung emains unwary of his selfless,dedicated,devoted but ugly wife,""a woman such as it is not commonly found"",o-lan and keeps mistress and is so absurdly misled by illusions and fakes. the reader deciphers in lung a man of basic and simple foundations,at times queerly naive,tainted by misapprehensions.    ""the good earth"" may be the moving tale of chinese farmer wang lung and his wife o-lan but this is not by any purpose singular or mundane in nature. pearl s. buck mirrors an essentially conservative and reserved chinese society in this her prize winning novel but,all the same ,hypocratic and deeply soaked in grotesque traditionalism. the disgraceful customs of slave trade and perception of a wife as ""a faithful servant"" are a couple of features highlighted by the authoress which reverberate even today in several culturs. ""have you not heard it said that in the sacred edicts it is commanded that man is never to correct an elder?"" the stucture of the plot has a certain symmetry about it and follows a more traditional yrt consolidatory paradigm occasioned with ghastly images of poverty,self-denial and self-improvement.    but for all the exemplars pearl s. buck's book launches,it's not without its fair share of dewfects. a number of flaws is given the go-ahead in as early as the seventh page when the authoress remarks about ""silver dollars"" in wang lung's village. this is a technical blunder as dollar was not a common item there then. again,the authoress is shrunk and limited in her descrioptions of a harrowing picture where sge could've been more elaborate:""then o-lan crept out and she took a great iron knife she had in the kitchen and she cut a grat gash in the beast's neck,and thus she served its life. and she took a bowl and caught its blood to cook for them to eat in a pudding,and she skinned and hacked to pieces the great carcass....."". this restrained sentimentality and employment of economy of words take the sting out of the tail really.    even so,these blemishes don't overshadow at all the forcce and sensibility of the book. the mazing facet about pearl s. buck is the conviction in her language bordering on a gentle assurance of an unique tale. ""the good earth"" is an immensely haunting pre-revolutionary china novel and is extensively ambitious. the writer merges familial and social lives and interlaces them with echoes of the past,regular rhythm of the present and disturbing notions of the future. ""but there was no peace"" is a catchphrase rippled throughout the book in various overtones,be it in wang lung's father's placidity,in his own distress,in the distant hints of a revolution or in the first signs of christian infiltration in china. in lung's craze for land,the reader would observe fragments of count leo tolstoy's short story ""how much land does a man need?"" and the disguised inevitable end. pearl s. buck's ""the good earth"" is a riveting read,a book that borrows its classic proportions from the well-drawn characters,ranging from the honest lung to the selfless o-lan,the cunning whore lotus to the deceiving first lung son,perfectly coalesced into a social setting that is forever promising to be on the shift. a timeless classic"	2
"i have not read this book but i am a real life eunuch. i had my testicles surgically removed. in an interview on salon.com the author says ""castration does not get rid of the sexual drive, get rid of erections or any amount of sexual activity."" wrong!!!  how would he know any way? he is not a eunuch. he has had a vasectomy but that is totally different. i can speak from experience; when a man becomes a eunuch his sex drive drops to absolute zero. i had a very strong sex drive prior to castration but it is now completely gone. the only way for a eunuch to regain his sex drive is to take some form of testosterone replacement. i have never heard of any real life eunuch who was not on testosterone replacement therapy that had a sex drive. don't waste your time on this book; the author obviously didn't do enough, if any research. if you want to learn about eunuchs then search the web. there are a lot of us out there, and our numbers are growing. what a real eunuch has to say."	0

"for the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. i cringe whenever i see god's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. in god's word he clearly gives his opinion on fictionalizing his holy book:    revelation 22:18-19 ""for i testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to these things, god will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, god shall take away his part from book of life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.""    proverbs 3):5-6 ""every word of god is pure; he is a shield to those who put their trust in him. do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you, and you be found a liar.""    one way to be found a liar and receive god's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto god's word where he has not made us privy to his details and outcome of events) his words and prophecies. fictionalizing the very last days before the lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. the authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by god's own words of warning in his book.    the authors have taken serious license in adding onto god's words in their left behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. there are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its ""christian"" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where god stands on these issues in his unchanging word. there are false representations of the mark of the beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. the books also have a huge misrepresentation of the antichrist. he is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.    at best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history jesus said would be the worst ever. the authors have gone far beyond author's license. we just are not allowed to do this with the word of god.    i urge christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the lord promised you would be for reading the book of revelation. ""blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near."" revelation 1:3    he has told us what he wants us to know. we don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it. merits zero stars"	0
eve and roarke fans will love this selection!!!!  the last chapter had me holding my ribs in laughter!  as usual eve works to exhaustion.  although the mysteries, i agree with other posts, were transparent, it will not disappoint diehard fans!!!  this series continues to surprise me that it still has so much life left in it!  bravo jd robb. born in death	1
i don't know how the guy does it. they keep getting funnier and there are always ones i've never seen before, as well as the ones i've always loved. you won't be disappointed if you are a far side fan. if you're not a far side fan, well, then i can't help you. keeps getting better	1
"the romantic days of the search for the ""missing link"" are gone, and as science writer carl zimmer reminds us, that is all to the good since the very idea of a ""missing link"" is a misdirection.  what we have today is the search for human ancestors and for a distinction to be made between our ancestors and other ancient hominids.  this book with its beautiful prints and photos, engaging drawings and helpful charts, and especially the sprightly text by zimmer brings the general reader up to date (circa 2005) on the latest developments.    there's a lot going on.  there's the controversy about homo floresiensis, thought to be a tiny hominid, found in indonesia in 2004.  zimmer presents the arguments.  some think that homo floresiensis is an island adaptation of home erectus, the first hominid to make it out of africa 1.8 million years ago.  after all, island adaptation often leads to diminished size.  there are fossils of now extinct small elephants in indonesia.  but others believe that the skull found is an anomaly, a case of microcephaly, a birth defect.  i'm betting on the latter.    there are wooden spears found that are around 400,000 years old, meaning that homo habilis or homo ergaster (who may be one and the same) or the more recently discovered homo heidelbergensis were accomplished tool makers long before homo sapiens arrived on the scene.  there is the idea that homo neanderthalensis is a cold climate, european adaptation of homo erectus.      part of the excitement in paleontology is in the new fossil finds, and part is in our new-found ability to analyze dna samples to map the spread of homo sapiens.  this allows us to see the ""out of africa"" phenomenon in three main stages: (1) homo erectus leaving africa 1.8 million years ago, followed by (2) homo heidelbergensis expanding into not only europe and the near east and china, but into southeast asia as well.  finally (3), about 130,000 years ago, homo sapiens begin to move out of africa, first into the levant and then into east asia and australia (50,000 years ago), then into europe and siberia (40,000 years ago) and ultimately into the americas (20,000 years ago).  incidentally, this book has homo sapiens coming onto the scene almost 200,000 years ago.    zimmer talks about the various hominid cultures and speculates on their social and religious possibilities.  on the subject of what happened to the neanderthal, he intimates that he believes it was a combination of things that allowed humans to survive while the neanderthals went extinct, including being better able to adapt to climate change, having a more sophisticated culture and better hunting techniques.  i think it's also possible (actually i think it's likely) that humans were better at killing not only herd animals but the competition as well, meaning that one of the reasons that the neanderthals are gone is because we killed them.  zimmer more or less skirts around this, waiting (wisely, i think) until further evidence is in.    in a final chapter, ""where do we go from here?"" zimmer briefly discusses biotechnology and genetic engineering, and how our species might be affected by cultural evolution.    this is a handsome book  it's like a coffee table book with the high gloss, heavy pages and the beautiful artwork, but smaller in size.  most significantly it is a book aimed at the general reader that is well written, well edited, and very well presented.  and it is clear.  it is in fact the clearest book on human origins--usually a very murky subject--that i have read.    by the way, zimmer is the author of several excellent science books.  i especially recommend his creepy, but fascinating, parasite rex: inside the bizarre world of nature's most dangerous creatures (2000). engaging text, beautiful artwork"	1
"the only reason i finished ""the transit of venus"" was the hope of any improvement.  this book took away two hours of my life-two hours that i can never earn back by reading true literature.  the story (is there a story?) is dreadful.  the sentence structures, the paragraph performances, the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if ms. hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her self-perceived insights.  i will never recommend this book to any audience.  ms. hazzard and her publisher should refund my money. i think ms. hazzard owes me an apology."	0
the story is great, and even educational. asimov's science and visual settings are excellent and, well, fantastic. but the characters were painfully cliche. perhaps they weren't when the book was written, but they certainly are now.    you have your main character: a tall, strong, and dashingly handsome take-charge guy of infinite courage.    and your sidekick (pretty much): a beautiful, young, intelligent woman who wants only to be respected for her intellect and not her perfect body and flowing hair.    the dialogue between these characters is ludicrous at best, and takes up a depressingly large amount of the novel. y'know - him constantly hitting on her in a rather pushy way, and her constantly deflecting his come-ons with a secret physical attraction for him. and yes, his heroic strength saves her more than once. and, of course, they get together in the end.    i respect asimov tremendously, but this book was like lucas' episode iii: a great story with a horrendous script and characters. and also like episode iii, i finished it trying to convince myself that i liked it, but was pretty much just annoyed that i gave it the time that i did. good story / bad characters	2
i found the book very difficult to use and almost never had what i was looking for.  the small dictionary in the back of my eyewitness travel guide was much more useful. mostly useless	0
"dave barry's novel is a quick read, but there's nothing fresh about the story or the characters.  the story centers on many different characters that become involved in a potential airport disaster--a columnist, his son, a rich, sleazy lawyer, a wannabe criminal, etc.  like elmore leonard's books, the characters begin to collide in unpredictable ways.  but the pay-off is just not that great.  you may find yourself thinking ""what's the point?"" after finishing the novel.    this book was made into a pretty forgettable movie that featured a great cast (tim allen, rene russo, stanley tucci, tom sizemore, etc.). cheap rip-off of elmore leonard"	2
this is an excellent resource for women with endo and for those who love them. i was encouraged by reading other women's stories to remind me that i am not alone. my husband has also learned a lot from the book and has become more sympathetic. it is a relatively easy read and is the best endo book that i have found. the book also has a sense of humor which is essential for anyone with endo. my only wish is that the book would have gone more in depth concerning alternative methods for treatment. overall, an awesome resource. very helpful, encouraging, and informative!!!	1
i used &quot;news reporting and writing&quot; when i studied journalism in college. upon returning to the college classroom to teach journalism, i introduced my students to the latest edition of this wonderful text. the book provides an excellent introduction to the various elements of good journalism and is perfect for a beginning or advanced course on reporting and writing. i recommend it highly. perfect for the classroom!	1
"i started reading this book, skipping the introduction and then realized this isn't the tao te ching at all. this is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said, and so he wrote his own version. it turns out the author admits this in the introduction. i wish i had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk. i guess i should have taken the hint with the ""a new version"" doublespeak on the front cover. sigh.  i usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs. not a translation."	0
"prepare to start hyperventilating as you read this book if you have only been exposed to the ""official"" version of 9/11. read it, and you may never again be able to stomach the words ""war on terror."" without throwing bricks, without partisan pot-shots, dr. griffin methodically lays out evidence which overwhelmingly suggests u.s. government complicity in the 9/11 attacks. yet, to his credit, all the author asks for is a genuine, in-depth, and independent investigation. (the 9/11 commission provided nothing of the sort, but that's the topic of his next book, ""the 9/11 commission report: omissions and distortions"")     part of what makes ""the new pearl harbor"" compelling is that it cites so many reports from mainstream media--newsweek, the washington post, the new york times, etc. quotes from these ""reliable"" sources appear in copious endnotes that together create a pattern. major media just hasn't connected the dots. (this, perhaps, is because its owned by people and corporations who profit handsomely from war.)    but in crime-busting 101, we learn to suspect those who benefit most from a crime. could our government be so monstrous as to sacrifice 3,000 of its own citizens to secure hundreds of billions of dollars in war funding for many years to come? our military trains leaders to think in terms of ""cost benefit."" securing a new american century of ""full-spectrum domination,"" to them, may be the prize that justifies such an atrocity. these and many other questions beg serious probing, not knee-jerk ridicule and dismissive labels like ""unpatriotic."" read this book, pass it on, and demand that congress start answering questions; many of the official aspects of 9/11 simply don't add up. take a deep breath and connect the dots"	1
i'm surprised this travesty is still in print.  &quot;not in mcluhan's style&quot; is a kind understatement; powers demonstrates flagrant misunderstanding and confusion of basic mcluhanesque ideas.  try 'laws of  media' or 'understanding electric language' instead. a shameful posthumous misrepresentation of mcl.'s thought.	0
elizabeth george in shorts is just as suspensful and whimsical as she is doing the long novel.  normally, i don't read short stories but decided to do so after finishing all of the inspector lynley books.  i definitely was not disappointed.  this lady comes with a great sense of humour in addition to her other sterling literary attributes. all the stories were suspensful right up to the final unexpected endings.  i, richard, the last of the stories, transforms history into modern day life.  both sad and amusing. elizabeth george in shorts	1
"prior to owning this book, i had never heard of robert a. heinlein.  i must say (sounding perverted, unfortunately) the only thing that really drew me to this book was the cover.  upon realization later, it looked somewhat similar to the statue ""venus demilo.""  as i read the book from the start, it really captivated me how detailed everthing seemed for a futuristic civilization.  it almost seemed as if rah, himself, had been there and wanted to share with the world, everything that he had seen.  though, mentioned in other reviews, the strong incestuous vibe the book pulls in later chapters is a slight bit of a turnoff, i feel it also adds to the story somehow.  almost as if it ties into his other books from certain pivotal points.  if some of the actions had not happened, the series and heritage would not have been what it was.  i do mention this as the first heinlein book i had ever read, so i may have mixed it up somehow.  even so, i daresay, this is a spectacular read, and should not be overlooked.  that, and read the other works he has out.  disappointed?  i think not. the first, but certainly not last heinlen."	1
although the author clearly loves his subject, he is not a good writer. there are awkwardly worded sentences, misspellings, wrong names and dates, and clichï¿½ after cliche. this is basically a rehash of the george eells' chapter that came out decades ago and offers little new information. the photographs are crudely reproduced and look like seventh generation photocopies. yes, the book is inexpensive, but it looks, feels, and reads like it. this must be a self-published book. the writer clearly needed an editor and a better printer. there's a better book out there. amateurish	0

"thayer went great lengths to produce an excellent lexical resource. many would agree. but shortly after publishing, his book became outdated. koine greek was no longer viewed as a holy spirit invention (which was thought for a long time since scholars could not find 10% of the nt vocabulary in secular writings until about the last century). since thayer's release, koine lexicography has taken great strides and has since left this dictionary far behind (see ""greek grammar beyond the basics"" by daniel b. wallace).    one positive of thayer's dictionary is his study of etymology. understanding how words form is very helpful in vocabulary memorization. but i'll add a word of caution illustrated by this short etymology lesson: ""butterfly"" does not mean ""a fly made of butter.""    as words evolve (or devolve), they do not always retain their meanings. koine vocabulary is an example that has been required to simplify in order to be accepted by various cultures. the words will not always fit etymological patterns or classical definitions.    why then is thayer's still so popular? it's cheap. it's public domain. and it's easy to use. purchase at your own risk.    recommended: ""a greek-english lexicon of the new testament and other early christian literature"" by walter bauer, frederick william danker (editor. thayer is no longer relevant. but..."	2
the author clearly has done his research and &quot;digging&quot; when it comes to the facts. then how come he is so bitter? jennings spends too much time not only disputing almost every other book about the french and indian  war, but also &quot;wrestling to the ground&quot; any thesis in opposition  to his own! he comes off sounding bitter, cranky and unattractive. his  glosses over the military aspects of the war as if these details are  beneath the serious historian--why? it was a war after all! it is not a bad  reference book but as far as read-don't bother. a very self righteous look at the f&amp;i war	2
this book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. first of all, we are living in the end times, and when jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. there's no seven years, no christians being zapped up, etc. this is our second chance on earth. no tribulation. this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a christian. why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. it's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. but i really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). man, not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck. unbiblical and bad writing make for one star	0
"""forensic files of batman"" truly is an entertaining read.  people often forget about batman's intelligence, overfocusing on the action elements of the dark knight genre.  while some readers and reviewers are nitpicking on little details (e.g. commissioner gordon still working, no mention of robin, etc.), this book is meant for all, not just diehard fans.  if you like good detective short stories or are a general batman fan, this book is for you. great, but unconventional batman book..."	1
overall the book (if you can call it that) does offer what its supposed to and does that in an effective manner. it teaches you how to develop persuasion. the trouble though is it only gives you the most basic outline on just 11 pages. the information that is contained inside of it is something that has been available for years in other similiar books. great stuff, low value	2
clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of ethnic cleansing. if the tables were turned and a jew, or a muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with judaism, or islam was brutally murdered than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. i do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of hateful filth!!. hate fiction	0
i thought this was one of the worst books i ever attempted to read.  the whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  when the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  avoid this one. desperate housewives prequel	0
whoever cares about iran or persia can get something from this book. it's not much of a &quot;journey&quot; in the sense of a travelog, but the conversations and the few glimpsed scenes are worth the price. the author  also provides lots of interesting, scholarly background, for example,  on  why iranians feel so unlucky, and why the cia is a sinkhole for good ideas.  maybe the saddest moment in the book was the brief chat the author had with  an older iranian, who practically begged to have us should bomb the  mollahs. it's sad, not because the mollahs are human beings and should live  in peace, but because the thought of the us doing something to rescue  people is so old-fashioned. view in the dark	2
this book was a real eye opener. after reading this book i am much more knowledgable about the foods available in the market and i am able to make better and healthier choices. my overall health has improved and i feel i have more energy than before. i would definitely recommend this book to anyone. an eye opener	1
year after year i wonder how koontz can continue to keep his writing fresh and entertaining.  i worry that he will become like many other authors and become predictable and boring.  happily- this has not happened to koontz.  his last several books have only gotten better for me, i have a hard time putting them down!    life expectancy starts off with a very interesting premise: jimmy tock's grandfather made a prediction on his deathbed the same day jimmy was born, listing 5 terrible days in jimmys future.  thus, the book begins and we are along for the ride to see what each of these 5 days hold in store for him and his family.  because the characters in this book are so enjoyable and loveable (as most of koontz's characters are!) i found myself in anticipation really hoping that these days wouldn't destroy them...    other stand out features of this book:  not predictable at all- from start to finish.  the ending was especially great in proving this point, as well as just great in general!  it was pretty fast-paced and kept the pages turning and did not leave me bored for a chapter.  the uniqueness of the story as well as the quirkiness.  lastly, to reiterate, the characters!!  koontz really goes above and beyond most authors i read (and i read a lot) in creating not only fun, unique and loveable characters- but they are also very memorable!  it's not often i can remember characters from a book in much detail, but koontz has such a gift that i can recall many, many of his characters and always find myself sad when their story ends.  i think that is the sign of an exceptional writer. koontz continues to churn out hits	1
i bought this book more for the stories than the recipes.  i was pleased with both, but the stories are my favorite.  i tried one of the recipes and it was excellent. love the stories behind the recipes	1
this book has a lot of useful information about puppy development and personality - but it recommends the choke-chain leash-correction training approach, which has been abandoned by many dog trainers. setting up situations so the puppy gets it right and is then rewarded is much more humane than jerking the poor little one around. good basic information, outdated training techniques	2
this book was very tender and i would reccomend it to anyone who really loves to feel. loved it!	1
i've made 2 of the recipes so far and am reluctant to try more. if i had known what i now know before i bought the book, i'd never have bought it.     the first recipe was a complete bomb: the tofu and vegetable curry, p. 105. i found it too hot and also bitter. thin, watery gravy; very hot; and a nasty, bitter taste -- yuck! i love curries, but this was by far the worst i've ever tasted. i'll never make it again!    the butternut squash soup, p. 98, was a little better. i liked it, but my husband didn't and wouldn't eat it (complained of a sour-milk taste). the soy milk and perhaps also the margarine had curdled over the long hours of cooking. and since cut-up squash isn't available in my town, the recipe took an hour of hard work, mostly to dismember a fresh butternut squash. i'll make this again when i can find cut-up squash, but i'll leave out the soy milk and margarine during the slow cooking. when the slow cooking is done, i'll puree the soup, then add the soy milk and margarine, and reheat gently on the stovetop. i think this will avoid the curdling and yield a creamier product.    my recommendation to others: don't waste your money on this clunker. not a happy buyer	2
this is one of my favorite books on entertaining.  i love all of martha's stuff and this one is one of my favorites.  anyone considering entertaining on any scale should pick this up and read it!. awesome book - pick it up	1
"""the denial of death"" is evasive and lacking in depth, not to mention excessively wordy.    it could be seen, for instance, that death is a philosophical uncertainty.  the denial of the absolute uncertainty of death (and uncertainty in general) could thus be a more profound form of denial.    it could also be seen that a human being is as dead before his conception as after his death, and his prior state of death did not prevent him from emerging into life.  death is then life-giving.  further, a living being is made of 'dead' matter - atoms as dead as those which make up rocks.  where, then, does life begin and death end, and vice versa?  is there ultimately a difference between death and life?    in the end, this central notion lacks imagination (at least you could credit freud with that), and has not been thoughtfully analysed, only assumed.    by contrast, ""the human evasion"" is an unblinking analysis of the human condition and our psychological defenses against it.

"steven stavropoulos has chosen some of the most well known quotes of the ancient greeks for this book, and some which are more difficult to find.  this is an excellent reference book for anyone who would like to quickly look up a quote on ""love"", ""virtue"", ""justice"", etc. i can see where his translation is slightly diffent from others that i have read, but the message is still transmitted very accurately.  this is a must own for anyone who enjoys reading about greek philosophy, theater or culture. concise and nearly complete "	1
there's not much to say.  the book isn't confusing because the material is too technical--it's often confusing because the author doesn't go in enough depth; it's frustrating when a crucial concept is presented, such as hamilton's law, but no examples on its applications are put forth.  i find myself frequently searching the internet to suppliment this textbook.  it also doesn't help that the book doesn't come with a cd-rom, or any additional material, unless you purchase the teacher's edition...reading this textbook makes me yearn for campbell. if only campbell were the author...	2
the worst book ever written about the middle east is probably joan peters' from time immemorial; in this book alan dershowitz not only attempts to usurp that dubious honor from peters, he also heavily plagiarizes half her book in order to do so.    the man who has made a career and a fortune as a lawyer mastering the art of defending and exonerating the guilty turns his gaze onto one of the international community's leading delinquents and most prolific violators of international human rights law, international humanitarian law and un resolutions.  his defending of nation states, however, is as unconvincing as his knowledge of historical events is laughable.    joan peters' book was completely demolished and shown to be a fraud by norman finkelstein, and even the most ardent of zionists have openly admitted the book is worthless.  20 years after that book faded into oblivion, alan dershowitz plagiarized much of its nonsensical arguments to masquerade as a book of his own.  for a full documentation of this plagiarism, see norman finkelstein's personal website.    by writing this book, dershowitz has inflicted more damage on israel than a thousand books criticizing it ever could.  any neutral who would read this book would realize how shoddy the case for israel really is; both the book and the `case' that dershowitz presents are nothing more than a pathetic assortment of lies, bigoted arguments, idiocies, misrepresentations and highly elaborate intellectual scams. hillariously nonsensical plagiarism	0

"this book is not a history in the since of most history books. it does not detail how the academy began, or how it changed over the years, or give you any kind of insider view of its workings. instead, it is a complete listing of every nominee and every winner in every category since the award ceremony's inception in 1927. there are plenty of photographs of the nominees and images  of scenes from the nominated films for each year, so it is not dry in the way many reference books are. in fact, mr. osborne's love of film and its history really shine through in the book. it is interesting to look through this book and see what we consider to be films that have withstood the test of time versus which ones were rewarded by the academy at the time. for example, in 1939, the academy did recognize that ""gone with the wind"" was the best picture of the year, which people were lining up to watch in movie theaters until its television broadcast premiere in 1976. however, in 1941, ""how green was my valley"" won best picture, which is a film that hardly anyone watches anymore, while ""citizen kane"" was completely ignored. it's also interesting to see how the academy compensated for past oversights by awarding performances that were less than stellar in subsequent years. for instance, in 1934 bette davis was overlooked in her performance in ""of human bondage"". this caused a huge public outcry. the following year the academy gave her the best actress award for her performance in ""dangerous""- a move that has largely been seen over the years as a consolation prize for what happened the year before.  this book is full of little insights such as these, and it is a fun book that gives hours of entertainment for film history buffs. i bought my first copy of this history by mr. osborne back in 1987 when he was then detailing the 60 years of the oscar, and i enjoyed it so much i have been updating my copy every time he releases a new edition. highly recommended. an all-inclusive encyclopedia of the academy awards "	1
i can not laud this book too highly.  it is meticulously researched and intelligently presented.    you will be astounded.  stunned, maybe.  did you know that the deadly form of the religion of peace got its start in boulder, co?    can you imagine that the people who were smart enough to bring down the world trade center were such superstitious morons that they thought a glucose iv bottle was attracting soviet bombers?    well, you will if you read this.  and that's just the start. a tight, well-researched anecdote of lust desguised as religion	1
"frank oski draws attention to the very real health dangers of commercial dairy products. unfortunately, he does consumers a grave disservice by encouraging the consumption of soymilk, an alternative that is even riskier. soymilk was rarely drunk in asia prior to the 20th century and like other modern, nonfermented soy products has been linked to digestive distress, thyroid damage, cognitive decline, add/adhd, immune system breakdown, infertility, reproductive disorders and even heart disease and cancer. sadly, many people have seen their health seriously deteriorate because of soy milk. children are at such risk that in july 2005 the israeli health ministry issued a health advisory warning parents that they should not feed their children soyfoods or soymilk more than once per day or a maximum of three times per week.  for people who would like to explore all sides of the milk controversy, i highly recommend ron schmid's ""the untold story of milk"". don't drink soy milk either!

"i give this memoir five stars for the the author's curiousity, acumen and intelligence, all of which inform this wide-ranging tale.      eating my words will answer your questions about mimi sheraton's adventures as a new york times food critic, travel writer and magazine editor, as well as stints spent as consultant to venues ranging from the famed four seasons restaurant to public schools and hospital kitchens.  through it all, sheraton reveals a keen intellect, a dedication to research, and a passion for accuracy.  her prose is direct rather than lyrical, but the reader will emerge with a better understanding of restaurants and both admiration and appreciation for a woman and writer who has lived her life well.    especially worthy savoring are sheraton's love for her husband, richard falcone-- their marriage of 49 years gives a happy backdrop to this memoir, and sheraton's reminiscences of her parents, who imbue her with wit, chutzpah, and lifelong curiousity about all things culinary.  also welcome are sheraton's  observations about the workplace: ""it's not your job, the employer has rented it to you,"" she observes, noting  that if the job no longer suits you, it is time to quit-- something that sheraton did several times in her career, including her departure from the new york times.    my appreciation for sheraton and this book grew as i progressed through the narrative.  my initial four star appraisal had grown to five my the end of this memoir, chiefly because of my admiration for sheraton and her well-lived life.  this is a woman who has lived with zest and integrity aned, thankfully, has chosen to share her experiences with us.  we should all be so lucky. the first & final word on food crticism & life"	1
"i had to read jared diamond's pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. the thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. however, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. i enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. i guess i was spoiled by first reading his sequel to ggs, ""collapse"" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. it has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -rk. crops, crops and more crops"	2
pat uses a lot of history in this book to get his point across,thus if you like history it is quite good, but be warned that if you don't like to read history, you may find yourself skimming through parts of the book where the history is particularly heavy,but he gets his point across.this is not to say this is a history book,but there is a lot of history reading in this book.this book is an excellant example of showing how we have gone too far trying to protect the world. another excellant book by pat	2
"""and so? i know: extrapolating bandwidth, processor speed, network dimensions, or the shrinking size of electromechanical devices has become truly tiresome. moore's law, first expounded by gordon moore in 1965, is indeed a stroke of brilliance, but one more mention of it should make you puke. terabit access, petahertz processors, planetary networks, and disk drives on the heads of pins will be ... they'll just be. face it - the digital revolution is over."" -- nicholas negroponte, 12/98    maybe this will silence some of the recent critics who've been tearing into this book.  yes, this stuff was actually interesting at one point, but we've heard too much about it at this point.  i own the book, and enjoy re-reading it occasionally (*very* occasionally) when i have nothing better to do, just to get some perspective on how things looked in 1995.  seems like a century ago, does it not?  things change so fast in the digital age that books like this are doomed to obscurity 6 months after they're published.  but in my opinion perspective on the past can be priceless, because knowing where we've been helps us figure out where to go next. negroponte agrees..."	2
"this book is beautifully written. even in translation, i was amazed by how gorgeous pamuk's prose is. some sentences from this book lingered in my head for days afterward. the main character, ka, is a poet, and the novel itself seemed very poetic to me, but not at all in a dense or difficult way. indeed, ""snow"" flows so smoothly that i would say it's a fairly easy read.    i wasn't sure if i would like this book at first because i didn't think i was particularly interested in islam and politics. i discovered that ""snow"" is primarily about god, love, beauty, happiness, death, life, and loneliness. while all the action takes place in a tiny turkish village, the themes are broad, sweeping, vast. this book will not grow dated any time soon, if ever. outstanding"	1
an unreadable book.  bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole.  to use delillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk.  each piece once meant something, but who knows what.     i finished it because i had read so many good reviews that i thought there must be something worthy in it.  sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end.  not in this case.  torture for 800 pages and then poof! delillo tidies everything up in an epilogue.  nice scenes and nice sentences and big ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read.  it was my first delillo book and it will probably be my last. reviews better than it reads 	0

i bought this book in august, 2006. at that time, my ra symptoms had me walking with a cane and unable to do any exercise other than very gentle water calisthenics. fast forward 3 months, and i feel better than i did before i got sick. i now work out on an elliptical trainer, practice yoga, or take a pilates class 6 days a week. neighbors who hardly know me comment on the improvement in my mobility (i guess a 30 yo woman with a cane is pretty noticeable.) i've also lost 22 pounds.     i know what the arthritis foundation and the rheumatologists say about ra and nutrition and i don't believe them anymore. i can't promise it will work for everyone, but if you have ra, please at least try the guidelines in this book. you owe it to yourself to do whatever it takes to get better.    only four stars because the text could be better organized. it works for me	2
wow. i wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of no stars. o'reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. fiction is clearly not his strong suit. his characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. if this trash is any indication of o'reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed. total garbage	0
"i think that it is good to read widely and get divergent perspectives.  thus, christians and jews should read the quran and muslims should read the torah and the new testament.  conservatives should read the nation or the new republic and visit the dailykos website and liberals should read the weekly standard or national review and visit realclearpolitics.  the same perspective applies with breyer's book.  regardless of your perspective, you should read this brief and easily understandable statement of judicial philosophy from a sitting supreme court justice.  (and, it would also be good to read the earlier counterpoint from justice scalia for the same reasons.)    breyer's book is a slightly revised and edited version of lectures he's delivered over the past few years.  it is therefore a mix of the spoken and written word which has advantages and disadvantages.  there's an easy informality conveyed from the ""spoken"" parts of the text that make the book almost conversational.  at the same time, there is the disorganization and carelessness that results from spoken delivery.  thus, sometimes the text is clear and orderly, the way written text often is, and other times it is a bit confusing and meandering the way text from speech often is.  if you want to study the book like a student, this style can get in your way and it also opens the book to criticism that may be correct, but unfair for the format (the mixed combination of written and spoken delivery).    breyer narrates his perspective on judging with a fairly simple description of his approach and then several examples to expand, elaborate, and demonstrate this perspective.  he argues that this perspective (""active liberty"") is useful in understanding constitutional law and that it should be employed widely by other judges.  he also directly compares his method to the ""literalist"" approach outlined by justice scalia.  while most of the narrative is written at a level the common reader can grasp, the details of breyer's perspective and the examples he provides appear to me to require a deeper knowledge of constitutional law for true appreciation.     i would strongly recommend that anyone with any remote interest in our constitution and the supreme court should read this book (and the counterpoint from scalia).  it is brief, readable, straightforward, and highly accessible to the common reader.    on a more negatively critical note of the perspective breyer describes, i have to express my surprise at the inherent danger in the approach.  breyer recommends that judges try to understand the purpose and consequence of the law in question and use an interpretation of purpose and consequence that relies upon the ""active liberty"" conceptualization.  (briefly, active liberty describes the actions of good citizenship.  breyer believes that the constitution is designed in part to encourage people to be good democratic citizens and that it is good to interpret law from this view.)  breyer takes the notion of active liberty from a prior source, benjamin constant and his essay, ""the liberty of ancients compared with that of moderns,"" (available for free online if you do a search).  thus, breyer is clearly and directly arguing that judges should go beyond the text of the law (and all the information in the controversy) and use an active meaning-making process to figure out what's really going on.    the most obvious danger to this approach is the variation in meaning-making of different people.  would a liberal-minded person really want a judge like jesse helms to use his personal meaning-making process; likewise would a conservative want a judge like ted kennedy to use his personal meaning-making process?  breyer seems to dismiss the obvious psychological variation that has to exist in different judges and assumes that each one can somehow correctly divine the true meaning of ""active liberty"" and then properly apply it in interpreting law.  the dangers and risk to this assumption seem transparent to me but not to justice breyer.  maybe they teach that at harvard law and, alas, i've only visited that beautiful campus.  my background as a graduate professor in persuasion and attitudes, an observer of myself and others, and my religious beliefs would strongly argue that people always want to justify themselves, their beliefs, and their actions.  justice breyer's argument that people can overcome their psychology with his approach is not foolish or careless or impertinent; it is to my education, training, and experience, wrong.    perhaps the best evidence of this is to first read breyer's take on the meaning of ""active liberty"" as he perceives it from constant's essay and then second read constant's essay for yourself and see how you understand what constant meant about ""active liberty.""  my problem is that i've read constant's essay and justice breyer's take on ""active liberty"" swerves more than just a little bit from what constant writes.  in particular note in your reading of constant's brief essay these statements:    ""it follows from what i have just indicated that we can no longer enjoy the liberty of the ancients, which consisted in an active and constant participation in collective power. our freedom must consist of peaceful enjoyment and private independence.""    ""similarly, the people who, in order to enjoy the liberty which suits them, resort to the representative system, must exercise an active and constant surveillance over their representatives, and reserve for themselves, at times which should not be separated by too lengthy intervals, the right to discard them if they betray their trust, and to revoke the powers which they might have abused.""    ""the danger of modern liberty is that, absorbed in the enjoyment of our private independence, and in the pursuit of our particular interests, we should surrender our right to share in political power too easily.    . . . let us ask the authorities to keep within their limits.""    justice breyer could have easily avoided this line of criticism by simply saying he wants to take an old concept, active liberty, and give it new meaning.  he could acknowledge constant and then develop ""active liberty"" to mean what he wants it to mean.  he would thus avoids any complaints about inconsistent reading of an old text and any potential finger-pointing about intellectual theft.  but, he didn't do that because he thinks his interpretation of constant's essay is correct.  he knows how to correctly make meaning.  and he does that when he judges constitutional law, too. read books written by sitting supreme court justices"	2
the variety of material available in 'the war of the jewels' is what makes this volume of the history of middle-earth series one of the best.    two things stand out.  first is the extensive writings on hurin after his release from angband.  in an extension and more fully recounted version of his tale, hurin's character and the consequences of his release are more fully explored, giving greater depth to the account given in 'the silmarillion'.    the other is the essay 'quendi and eldar'.  this is a treasure-trove not only for the tolkien linguist but anyone interested in the history of the elves.  through an examination of the different words used by the elves to refer to themselves and their different divisions, the look at their history as they themselves saw it is priceless.  other parts of the essay and accompanying material fill out references found in 'unfinished tales', etc.    'the war of the jewels' has many stories worth reading on their own that are great examples of the depth and the layers of the legendarium. a resource for true students of tolkien	1

"my hope was to read a novel that gave an accurate and detailed account of the world my grandparents lived in and i was not disappointed. as with the best historical fiction, i was able to gain a sense of not just the environment and setting, but its effect on the main characters, especially david, the main protagonist.     while the prose is often challenging and innovative, the book is a surprisingly easy and quick read that i could not put down. while i was often frustrated by david's inner dialogue, the author must be commended for attempting to convey the inner workings of a child's mind, how his thought process often chaotically bounced around from one thought to another. the author also uses language in a very unique and interesting fashion, namely the contrast between early 20th century new york slang, composed of so many different ethnic groups, to the authors ""translation"" of eastern european yiddish.     for anyone currently reading the novel, who might feel frustrated at a seeming lack of direction in the plot, my advice is to keep reading, as its themes of alienation, growing self-awareness, family, sexual awakening and assimilation become more apparent as the story progresses. and for those who have yet to read the book, i strongly recommend not reading the introduction until after you've finished the book, as it pretty much gives away almost everything that happens in the story and really should have been the afterword. regardless, it happens to be a well-written analysis of the novel and can even help the reader in his or her own thoughts and opinions of what is most definitely a classic of 20th century literature. excellent tale of early 20th century jewish immigrant life"	1

"the ""bad"" news:  probably 2/3 - 3/4 of the books out there today related to dating, relationships, and attracting and/or seducing women are garbage.    i'm the author of my own book, ""mode one: let the women know what you're really thinking,"" so i often tend to read other books that i feel might have similar messages and/or philosophies to my own.    ""m.a.c.k. tactics: the science of seduction meets the art of hostage negotiation"" is a very entertaining and informative read.  the book first caught my attention on page 18, page 19, and page 20.  these pages talk about taking action, and building confidence.    self-confidence is the greatest psychological ""aphrodisiac"" for seducing women.  women leave hints and clues about this all of the time.  page 31 is great advice also.  the whole entire chapter 5 is worth the price of the book.    read it ... you won't be disappointed. this book is very well-written, and informative"	1

seierstad writes a compelling book about cultural and personal differences.     i actually can read between the lines the efforts of a man who is trying to find his own voice in a system that does not work as we think.    with seierstad's candid observations, one might feel compelled to shout and scream... but yet any body who does not have the opportunity to stand out and taste criticism will shield from taking actions.     i loved the way the author was able to clearly state facts and jumped into her emotions (and i can only imagine the shock). most people will fail to recognize the main character's effor to provide for an honorable way of living, help his younger wife to read, and do his best.     when we read the book without judgement, we are able to understand how we differ. i actually think i can understand why this or that happens.. reconstruction after war is hard, anybody who has had to live and survive a very strict regime builds up character or shuts down. i usually found myslef thinking what would i do as any of the character's personalities emerged... it was fascinating.     i smiled at the young teenager boy... thinking of my brother, then my son..  of my feminist father and how he would try to emancipate his daughters and truly believe the guy is making a difference in his culture which might be less shocking than if we took someone from our culture to make drastic changes.    the insecurity portraid by the female characters also happens to so many people (mostly woman who chose to stay at home to care for kids for a while) who leave the competitive world to nurture others.     but most importantly, the book is a gift of courage on everyone.. to tell how they see it, and not pretending to live in a perfect world. i admire their courage, from the comfort of my house, with water and electricity, glass windows and no fear that i'll get bombed.     i couldn't put it down...     if you want a total shock, read it with 'emergency sex'(and other desperate measures. before you judge.. get the other's shoes on... 	1

"quigley was a georgetown professor who was permitted access for two years in the early 1960's to the private archives of the committee on foreign relations, a rockefeller internationalist organization that compliments the work of the trilateral commission and the royal institute of international affairs.      it is difficult to determine what the author is trying to communicate.  there is no continuity to the book; nothing ties together quigley's version of the past and of the future.  it's like reading about the solar system and finding out that the conclusion of the matter is that the sun will expand and burn everything up.  you are left wondering, what is the point?      we are left with the suggestion that the elite should continue to guide us in the same direction that we are traveling, but avoiding some of the monumental blunders that they have made in the past.    quigley's version of history consists mostly of unquestioning repetition of propaganda.  quigley did a superficial job of analyzing history, and he is even worse at sociology.  he touts inclusive diversity as our great strength and greatest gift.  perhaps he should have considered the aphorism, ""divide and conquer.""  the west, or any other empire, can only flourish when it concentrates on matters of common concern, not divisivness      quigley does slightly better with economics and foreign policy, which are more in his area of expertise.  he correctly observes that british and american ""victories"" in wwi and wwii resulted in the almost total destruction of international law.  quigley is in favor of the idea of continental blocs replacing national states.  as globalization unfolds, quigley exposes some of the hypocrisy and bungling, yet  he inexplicably remains committed to the overall plan.    so, what is the point of all of this costly meddling?  quigley predicts success...and then failure.  ""we shall undoubtedly get a universal empire in which the u.s. will rule most of western civilization.  this will be followed by a period of decay and ultimately by invasions and the total destruction of western culture.""  couldn't we save ourselves the trouble and just mind our own business?       minding our own business is a concept based on the idea that the electorate is in control of the government, and that we have a choice.  however, quigley admits that international financiers influence and control governments.  quigley says that the internationalists, who prefer to remain in the background, should be known for their ""valuable"" contributions.  what these contributions amount to is that they want world government, and they intend to cram it down everyone's throats.    as we slouch toward financial, industrial, and government monopoly the author reminds us of some of the casualties.  ""as economic enterprises have become larger and more tightly integrated into one another, the freedom, individualism, and initiative traditionally associated with the modern economy have to be sacrificed."" quigley acknowledges that in our future, ""in general, there will be a very considerable modification of the areas and objectives of freedom in all societies of the world, with gradual reduction of numerous personal freedoms of the past.""    to add to this loss of freedom, quigley bemoans our loss of a spiritual mooring and suggests a return to the values of christianity!   his version of christianity, of course.  still full of contradictions, quigley cleaves to relativism rather than absolutes, approximations rather than final answers-not realizing that the adoption of these mindsets are what weakened the appeal of christianity.    finally, as we follow our present course, quigley predicts an age of conflict characterized by class struggle, war, irrationality, and declining progress. obviously, we're there now.       rather than attack his sponsors, who are bringing us this new world order, quigley vents his frustration on the middle class.  quigley touts the moral superiority of both the rich and poor, but he asserts that the middle class consists of poorly-informed, neurotic, bourgeois, radical-right republicans. worst of all, they have puritanical attitudes toward sex.     the many internal contradictions in this book indicate a confused mind or a shallow thinker.  the author's history is mostly stale propaganda, spiced up with occasional pro-government cheerleading or tales of government boondoggles.     maybe if quigley had broken this monstrosity into several different books, he would have had something coherent to say.  in this book, quigley's  conclusion is almost totally divorced from the rest of the book.  this effort spanned 20 years, and possibly senility was sneaking up on the author. 1300 pages are too many"	0

"great! it was about time that the biggest monster of them all was exposed. ""biggest"", not simply because of the unprecedented number of deaths that he caused, but because he was so utterly trivial. as jung chang/halliday show, he wasn't ideologically inspired, he had no liking for his own country and its tremendous culture, and he couldn't sustain mature relationships with other human beings. his motivation was apparently selfish, spiteful and capricious, like the school bully who finds himself running the school. he let the chinese people starve, while pumping resources abroad to pay for military technology or win the approval of third world tyrants and ""liberation movements"".  again, great! because this book may remind us in the west just how foolish many of our bright young people were back then. on the political demos of the sixties, the maoists stood out for their brutality and brainlessness, and total lack of any sense of humour. many of the intellectuals of the time seem to have been either fooled by maoism, or bought. they did dirt on the values of their own culture while (figuratively or literally) waving the little red book. most of them have moved on, but this book might just remind them of creepy behaviour that they'd prefer to forget.  finally, two criticisms that have been made of jung chang/halliday by some reviewers. firstly, the lack of balance. well, was there anything remotely attractive about mao or the things that he did? he ""reunited china"" - yes, but that doesn't mean that without him it would never have happened, in fact some of the political opponents that mao destroyed along the way might, given the chance, have presided over a far less monstrous regime.  secondly, the journalistic style of the book. true, occasionally it lapses into cliche, but the text remains accessible and easily readable for anyone who wants to know more about mao. compare this with mao's own turgid platitudes, or the incomprehensible screeds of marxist intellectuals.   let mao have the last word. in 1940 he wrote the following, and one might stop to consider how he lived up to this commitment to the chinese people, and at what cost to them: ""it is not hard for one to do a bit of good. what is hard is to do good all one's life and never do anything bad, to act consistently in the interests of the broad masses, the young people and the revolution, and to engage in arduous struggle for decades on end. that is the hardest thing of all!"". well done!"	1

"ronald kessler has given us a book that is quite pleasant on several levels.  first, it is nice to get to know more about the first lady.  while all of the wives of the presidents are admired by americans, laura bush is particularly admired and loved.  she projects a warmth and intelligence that draws admiration and affection.  kessler gives us just enough about her origins to let us know that the calm and strength we see has been there from her beginnings and what her early life was like.  her friends recall instances of her calming influence and strength that resonate with what we see in her public appearances.    second, we get to see the truly loving and mutually supportive marriage of george and laura.  the stories of how they came together, the struggle to have kids and the birth of the twins, their finding their way in life as part of the bush clan, and much more is quite engaging.  the picture we get of them as people is quite different than the phony images the media paints of them (i.e. george likes to read).  we also learn a couple things about laura that we might find a bit surprising (i.e. she is still a ""stress smoker"").    third, just as we gain a more real image of their marriage, we also get corrective information about false stories about each of them that were touted so loudly during the election.  the fatal accident that laura was involved in as a youth, her supposed drug dealing, george's supposed drug use at camp david, and many more are all cleared up quite specifically.  it is great to get the real story from the people who actually know and go on record rather than the gossip and innuendo put forward by kitty kelly and her ilk.    kessler has given us a book that reads easily, is not overly fussy in detail, and gives us a portrait that we feel good about and comfortable with.  there are several pages of interesting pictures for laura's life.  we come away feeling comfortable with our admiration for her and realize that she is an even better person than we had suspected.    good book and one that you should read in order to get a more accurate picture of our first lady and the president. find out who she really is and get some false media stories corrected"	1
"president ulysses grant called the 1846 u.s. invasioin of mexico, ""the most unjust war ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.""  i see whatever piece of the ""american dream"" that immigrants (legal or not) get from coming here as a sort of reparations for all the harm our military empire has caused other nations.  pat buchanan has said, ""if people don't want terrorism, we have to give up our empire.""  i think he's right, i'd just add that the same goes for immigration.  to curb the influx of economic refugees, we have to reform nafta, end the exploitative behavior of transnationals (many us-based) in the maquilladoras, support fair trade, end the dirty work of places like the school of the americas and figures like ""economic hit men,"" and so forth.  moreover, wooldridge and others often speak as if the ""minute men"" are the only civic group working on the issue of immigration.  thankfully, there are groups like the american friends service committee and border links that have a much more intelligent analysis of migration, and far more humane approaches to this complex issue.    as general smedley butler said, ""war is a racket,"" and that includes this war on immigrants.  there is a lot of money that is being made from the building of a high-tech fence, aerial drones, motion sensors, videocameras, detention centers, and the other equipment of a police state.  if we let that industry grow because of one scare or another . . . well, we won't recognize this country as the land of the free and the home of the brave.    rather than wooldridge's fear and resentment-mongering, i'd recommend the upcoming boook by free speech radio news host, deepa fernandes, which is titled, ""targeted: homeland security and the business of immigration.""   we could also learn a lot by listening to the leaders of mexico's own movements for justice.  there are many books and dvds available regarding the courageous efforts of the zapatistas.

"in the interests of full disclosure, i should start by saying that craig and i shared an editor at macadam cage and he is a good friend.  several years ago, at the national book expo, craig and i swapped copies of our books.  i gave him a copy of my book ""the locklear letters,"" and he gave me a copy of ""the contortionist's handbook.""  when he called me to meet him for dinner several months later, i felt compelled to pick his book off the bookshelf and read it.  i was amazed.  rarely have i found a book so compelling that i thought about it all day and felt the need to race home to read some more of it each night.  it is a great achievement.  original, thought-provoking, chilling. a fantastic, compelling read"	1
"two of the short stories in this book, ""running out of dog"" and ""gone down to corpus"" are not new stories.  running out of dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from mr. l. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people.  but, it should have been noted that 40% of this book is not original.      the others are average reads, over before we have any understganding of the characters mr. lehane writes so well about.  none of the others are full of tension, irony, comedy, tragedy, and suspense we've all come to expect. they are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author's excellent reputation.    we waited a long time for another lehane.  this book certainly does not showcase his talents. something old, something used."	2

"frances mayes, author of under the tuscan sun, did not set out to write a typical travel book with a year in the world. she wanted to forgo the usual hotel stays and the trekking from one tourist hotspot to the next, and instead aimed to discover, ""could i feel at home here? what is home to those around me?""    renting (mostly luxurious) homes in such places as fez, turkey, italy, greece, portugal and britain, mayes and her husband set about attempting to truly feel at home in these various locations. while this premise sounds interesting enough, mayes struggles to convey her experiences to her audience. her writing seems at times not to wander far from notebook sketches, yet at other moments is full of self-important prose and metaphors so tired i want to pick them up and carry them. and all throughout, she peppers long - and quite unnecessary - quotes from the various books she is reading along with recipes, and descriptions of gardens that go into far too much detail. the result seems disjointed and too clever, and renders the book very difficult to read.    a year in the world does have some fine moments, such as mayes' evocative descriptions of local food that reveal her delight at discovering new taste sensations. but mostly i found myself wanting more - such as when she prefers to conjure up imaginative images of historical scenes rather than inform the reader of the often fascinating true history - or i found myself wanting less, as many inclusions in the book seem superfluous. the impression i ended with was not of what it meant to be `at home' in the countries mayes and her husband visited, but of what is was to have a series of obviously expensive holidays that centered around food, gardens, and literature. evocative but disjointed"	2
this book struck me as unique on several levels.    first of all it is a serious, thorough examination of the 21st century mafia and stock scams, through the eys of a serial swindler working for the mob.      but what really appealed to me about this book was its writing style, which was unique among the mob books i've read in being offbeat and satirical. it is very unusual to read either a mob or a business book, and this book falls in both categories, that approaches its subject in that manner.    you practically have to go back to jimmy breslin, and his gang that couldn't shoot straight, to find a less reverential view of the mob. the difference is that breslin was working in fiction and this is a true story.     in business, the only parallel is michael lewis' liar's poker, which of course delved into an entirely different side of wall street. offbeat, satirical	1
"in ""epicenter"" joel rosenberg provides the background information that drives his novels about the middle east and the end times.  this nonfiction book will grab readers' attention due to its analysis of current events through the lenses of politics and economics.  however, rosenberg insists that a third lens of biblical prophecy is necessary in order to truly understand what is happening in the middle east today.  but is rosenberg's third lens properly focused?  has he understood ezekiel's prophecies correctly?    it should first be recognized that rosenberg's approach to biblical prophecy is nothing new; he follows the general outline of end time events that have been taught for years by dispensational premillennialists.  all the bible scholars that he relies upon fall within that school of prophetic interpretation.  they include c.i. scofield, john walvoord, and hal lindsey.  he refers to tim lahaye as ""arguably the world's preeminent prophecy expert"" (p. 288).    during the thirty-seven years since my conversion and the twenty-eight years in which i have pastored an evangelical christian church, i have studied both the biblical prophecies and the modern-day prophecy teachers.  at the beginning of my christian life i was convinced that the prophecy teachers had the future figured out, but i have learned over time that they are less than reliable.  for example, lindsey suggested in ""the late great planet earth"" that christ would return in 1988.  in the first edition of ""the beginning of the end,"" lahaye said that world war i was the first sign of the end times, but in the 1991 revision of the book he changed that first sign to the founding of the modern nation of israel in 1948.  so i approached rosenberg's book with caution.    ""epicenter"" gives the impression that ezekiel 38 and 39 are easy to understand.  rosenberg does not mention that evangelical scholars disagree.  peter craigie says, ""the series of prophecies concerning gog . . . are among the most difficult parts of the entire book of ezekiel to interpret.""  even dispensational premillennialists cannot agree on when ezekiel 38 and 39 are going to be fulfilled.  will it be before, during, or after the tribulation?  or will it be after the millennium?  advocates for each position can be found.    rosenberg also skips over what ezekiel 37 meant to ezekiel's contemporaries.  since they were living in exile in babylon when ezekiel delivered his prophecies, wouldn't they naturally have thought that the divine promise of return to the land referred to them?  but rosenberg doesn't even mention that possibility.  instead he takes a hermeneutical leap and immediately applies the prophecy to modern israel's founding in 1948.    the biggest error comes from rosenberg's reliance upon a nineteenth century scholar's teaching that in ezekiel 38:3 ""rosh"" refers to russia (pp. 85-86).  even dispensational premillennialists like charles dyer and ralph alexander reject that interpretation.  what about ""meshech"" and ""tubal""?  in his novels rosenberg readily identifies them as moscow and tobolosk, but in ""epicenter"" he briefly mentions that questions have been raised about those identifications.  scholars today understand those terms to be names of tribes that lived in the area of modern-day turkey.  why does rosenberg prefer outdated scholarship?    it's worth noting how the author deals with the other nations mentioned in ezekiel 38.  by the amount of emphasis he places on events in persia (or modern iran), he implies that it will be the major ally of russia in its attack on israel.  but is that suggestion derived from the text itself, or is that an interpretation rosenberg imposes on the text in light of current events?  ezekiel himself does not highlight persia any more than cush or put.    rosenberg points out that egypt is not mentioned in ezekiel 38 as an ally of russia (p. 132).  that, he suggests, is evidence of ezekiel's remarkable accuracy since egypt currently has a peace treaty with israel.  but in 1970 hal lindsey identified egypt as a key member of russia's ally called ""the king of the south"" in daniel 11.  how can two prophecy experts come to such contradictory conclusions?    paul boyer observed in his excellent book, ""when time shall be no more.""  ""while the core structure of the premillennial scenario remained remarkably stable for 150 years, new events were continually elevated to the status of `prophetic fulfillments' or `end-time signs' while individuals or events that failed to live up to their expected role were quietly dropped . . . the historian, reading hundreds of prophecy books published over a two-hundred-year period, can readily see this process of inserting current events into an archaic belief system.  the average believer, encountering the genre for the first time, may be stunned by the uncanny contemporaneity of the prophecies.""    timothy weber likewise writes in ""living in the shadow of the second coming,"" ""in retrospect, premillennialists had shown more enthusiasm than accuracy in their interpretations . . .  their leaders were confident that biblical prophecy was being fulfilled, but events kept forcing them to reevaluate their interpretations of how it was being fulfilled.  one is struck by how forgiving and forgetful the premillennialist rank and file must have been during this period.  they stuck by their leaders even when they misread the signs of the times.  the leaders themselves seemed little deterred by their mistakes.  events were changing so quickly that they had little time for apologies.""    while ""epicenter"" may become a bestseller, i'm afraid that it will eventually prove to be just another prophetic disappointment. another prophetic disappointment"	0
like other reviewers listed here, i thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half-a-century old (if not older)using pithy, witty humor and comparisons of the writer's life and child's life.  to be fair, there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book, but as an avid cook and child fan i wish there had been more.    i think there is a market today for food writing; good food writing, like mfk fisher and elizabeth david, but i don't think julie powell even comes close.  the julie/julia project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated (to whatever extent) in some very profound experiences, like working for the government agency dealing with the world trade center memorials, a household move in nyc, dealing with a less than stellar marraige, and coping with very needy friends and family.    julie, get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write!  forget the food, it's just not you.  stick to your hoo-hum job, your even more narcissistic friends, and your boring marraige and you could be the next nora ephron, or at the very least, erma bombeck. not what i thought this would be	2
"i bought a copy of this book and it is forcing me to give greater attention to an arguably important part of handicapping, therefore, it might be worth the money.    while klein's percentage of winners and return-on-investment calculations are adequate for the leaders at the first call, they are without merit for those that do not lead because he dumps both categories in together. this statistical error causes a disparity, but it only ""seems"" that the roi between leaders and non-leaders looks larger. but, sheesh, there is only one leader but several non-leaders. using basic math, if the win percentage for leaders in a certain category is 30% then the win percentage for non-leaders is 70%.     using steve's calculation method, in an 8-horse race you would bet $2 on the leader and $14 (the ""non-leaders"" times 2)on the non-leaders. even if a non-leader won there would still be six losers among the non-leaders so the ""win percentage"" is just 14 percent. unless the winner pays off at more than 6-1 odds it's a negative return-on-investment!    in my opinion, look to other handicapping books for a better return on investment. think return on investment"	2

"as a software developer i found most of the information in this book to be something less than earth shattering.  basically, there are companies that specialize in data mining as much information on us as they can.  the present administration is drooling over the possibility to use this information.  a large percentage of the information stored in the databases is in error.  that's pretty much the book.  should we be concerned?  yes, but not of the information existing because its mostly public information anyway that is being linked in creativie ways.  i'm not an advocate for this by any means but i'm not terribly fearful of it either.  what does concern me, and should you, is how much of the information is wrong and how difficult it is to get these companies to fix it.  to me, that was the greatest point the book made.    as for government spying.  we know now that the government is surveying us in much greater and more orwellian ways than we would have thought possible.  unfortunately, this is what i wanted to learn more about and is pretty much missing from the book.  also, there is no ""solution"" provided.  how can we protect ourselves?      mainly, i was disapointed be because every person mentioned in the book has a drawn out biography provided about them.  i really didn't care how the ceo of a data mining company grew up.  i wanted to learn about the subject of the book, not history of indivuals.    its not a bad book, but i grew tired of the biographies and the content didn't surprise me or frighten me enough to be real impressed. tedious"	2

the reading was okay, but there wasn't much meat to it. each page has a paragraph or maybe two that tells a story. only a handful are interesting as many explain boring stuff like where pictures of old executives are located. one of the most interesting pages told about how disney bought up all of the fl property using fictitious companies. for the price, i was disappointed as most of it is not notable. if you're a disney buff, get this from the library and save the $$$ - you can read it in a 1/2 hr sitting. slim book	2
"i was looking for some christian books that will help me understand the bible better and found this one from the library. just a glance of this book got me on the alert side. although the title of the book bears the name of jesus, it is largely based on the author's personal meditations than the bible. the author refers very little to the bible. and, the chapter ""rise above karma"" annoys me as it relates ""karma"" to the bible teachings. is not ""karma"" a term for hinduism and buddhism? what is dangerous about this book is that it mentions the names of god and jesus so often that without discernment it is easy to mistake this book as one of the christian books. the bible tells us to beware of teachings like this. a reader from irvine"	0

"when i got this book, i couldn't put it down.  after reading it, i was anxious to get started on setting my goals as mr brown described in chapter 16, but i hit a roadblock.  mr. brown gives an example of the goal planner, but he didn't show how the math works to get the amount one should save each month.  mr. brown even states,    ""the following goal-setting forms will serve as a map in guiding you toward your desired financial goals.  they are here to assist you in your planning.  feel free to use the formula over and over again for your actual desires.""    one frustrating problem, mr. brown gives no formulas.    i followed up by going to mr. brown's company website and sending an e-mail explaining my frustration, i got a reply telling me to visit the website and click on ""need a financial plan.""  this requires me to enter in my credit card information and be charged $25 for mr. brown to preform the calculations for me (the same calculations that should be outlined in chapter 16).  in addition, i get a free copy of a book that i just bought.  what?!    i bought this book expecting to be given the tools to be independent when setting up my goals.  or at least to understand how calculations are made before i seek out professional help.  but mr brown only brought me halfway when he suggests ways to set up goals and then in turn doesn't fully explain them. great advice, but no follow through"	2
i was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because i felt like a traitor when i didn't like this book.  i wanted to like it, i really did - but it was very dull.  i ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.    the first chapter started out with a bang and i was totally hooked.  it didn't take long to lose me.  boooooring.  i didn't like sophie, i didn't like royd (royd - are you kidding?  perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  i wasn't interested in the direction the book went.      i thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  if sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  she was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.    royd was so very unlikeable i couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  ick.    adding jane into the book was very contrived.  plain old artist jane and her cop stepfather joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  it seemed like a ploy to connect eve duncan with this book.  not at all believable.    the one sentence that i found interesting was when michael thought that jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  it seemed to be a lead in to the next book.    the first ij book i ever read was ugly duckling.  hopefully ij re-reads that one before starting the next one.  give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...]. i was glad to read all the low reviews...	2
like many others, i'm a big fan of the ladies no. 1 detective agency series, but this is a really poor entry that barely even bothers to go through the motions. first of all, mma ramotswe has only one case to deal with, a wealthy woman who wants her four suitors checked out to eliminate any golddiggers. the first two she checks out are interesting enough, a bible-thumper seeking to reform bar girls, and a slick radio dj. but smith doesn't even get around to the other two, and wraps up that storyline in a very abrupt way. another plotline revolves around mr. j.l.b. matakoni and a dishonest competitor garage, but this is small potatoes that doesn't really amount to much. a third plotline involves mr. j.l.b. matakoni's getting dragooned into a parachute jump to raise money for the orphanage, again, doesn't amount to much. the last major plotline concerns the marriage between mma ramotswe and mr. j.l.b. matakoni -- or rather, the lack thereof. the resolution to this is completely anti-climatic and doesn't do justice to the event. one might forgive the weak plotting if there was some really juicy character development, but there isn't. even worse, some major characters almost totally disappear: mma makutsi has very little role, and the two orphan children adopted by mr. j.l.b. matakoni appear only once or twice. the book's got the same warmth and humor as the rest of the series, but it's all sort of perfunctory. one doesn't get nearly the same feel for the country and people. the overall is like looking forward to a weekend visit with old friends, only to find them totally distracted and distant. big bummer of a book. very weak entry in the series	2

this under-appreciated work is slowly gaining the recognition it deserves from woolf critics... but i would say that, since i wrote my dissertation on it! woolf's fiction is never light reading, but woolf lovers will here  find a masterful synthesis of descriptive power, her exhaustive knowledge  of english history and literature, her feminism, her passionate hatred of  war and her conviction that only aesthetic experience can enable humanity  to question the status quo and *perhaps* create a better world...  interested readers might consider reading it alongside the years, three  guineas, moments of being, the last volumes of the diary, or such woolf  essays as &quot;thoughts on peace during an air raid,&quot; as well as  shakespeare's tempest. this slim novel speaks volumes; it is a work of  mature genius by one of the 20th century's greatest writers. a work of mature genius by a great writer	1

heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention.  unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere.  this shoddy technique is found in all four of hienlein's final books.  we are also treated to some of heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips.  without these archetype characters most heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed.  as if this isn't enough, heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing.  in spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout.  heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys.  this novel, as well as most of heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption. another self-indulgent heinlein novel	2
"unfortunately, i was forced to read this book by my photography professor. every word, every page, was sheer hell to struggle through. trying to follow barthe's chaotic train of thought is next to impossible. this book is full of navel-gazing gibberish that can only loosely be described as ""english"". he admits to not being a photographer, and goes on to claim photography itself doesn't exist. how then, did he write a whole monstrous book on photography? and moreover, why am i being subjected to it?    my heart is warmed somewhat when i read of mr. barthe's history. he spent a lifetime suffering from tuberculosis, and ended it splattered across the front of a van. good. the bastard deserved it for what he's inflicted on hapless undergrads around the world. this book was almost physically painful to read"	0
"this book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or european or is overly valued in american history textbooks.  loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.

"when i first started reading this book, the story seemed so outlandish that it all seemed too silly.  soon, though, i realized that it was a satirical look at a serious subject (censorship) and that the humor was actually a very effective way of getting the point across.    the story is told in letters, predominantly between 19-yo cousins tassie and ella but occasionally in letters from or to their parents, neighbors and the nazi-like town council that begins prohibiting the use of letters of the alphabet as they fall from their hero's statue (nollop, inventor of the sentence ""the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.""--of note because it contains every letter of the english alphabet).    the idea that a government, especially one in a society as literate and as committed to honoring the english language as this one, would strangle its citizens with such laws is ludicrous; it is not only interesting but amusing to see how the community deals with the laws and their effects.  first, like sheep being led to slaughter and, later, taking charge of their own destinies.    i found ella minnow pea a very quick and enjoyable read.  it is light and funny but yet gives you something to think about.  if you are a fan of language, you will likely enjoy it.  it is rare that i come across a book that has a word in it with which i am not familiar; this book contained many words unfamiliar to me--a truly impressive level of vocabulary (though some words were, i think, coined by the islanders as a way of dealing with the prohibited letters).    i recommend this book--especially for those who, like i, are concerned about the direction our society is taking in terms of censorship. silly (satirical) look at a very serious subject."	2
"englishman tony judt's postwar is an ambitious and worthwhile undertaking: to give a coherent account of the history of europe from 1945. the outline of events is well known: a continent in ruins at the end of the second world war, the miraculous rise of western europe from the wreckage, the concurrent enslavement of the east, and thence the titanic struggle between the two world systems, culminating in the triumph of liberal democracy over totalitarian state control. it is a great story, surely one of the finest chapters in the history of human civilization.    judt seems to take the view (with which most people would likely agree) that great shifts in history ultimately rest upon the underlying economics. in the big picture, communism failed because it was unproductive, capitalism succeeded because it was the opposite. the question he asks is a good one: why did it happen when it did? why, after having survived so long (since 1917, in the case of the soviets) did the eastern block suddenly collapse at the end of the eighties, and so rapidly?     his answer is, astonishingly, the helsinki accords. ""against all expectation,"" he claims, ""it [brezhnev's signing of the helsinki accords] was to prove mortal."" (p. 503). the argument here seems to be that by having agreed to the helsinki accords (which included some boilerplate language on human rights), the communist leaders were thereafter hamstrung in suppressing those dissidents who dressed their opposition in terms of human rights rather than as political attacks against the party.    he thus attributes the collapse of communism to the role of dissenters within the non-soviet eastern block countries. judt seems not to have grasped that these countries were just the playing field, not the actual players. he refers to himself as having been in czechoslovakia at this time; perhaps this is why he seems to think that the minor protest groups within the soviet satellites were something other than marginal--as causal agents rather than benefactors of larger forces. in this book, vaclav havel plays a far greater role than ronald reagan in the collapse of communism. in fact the name ""reagan"" itself only appears a dozen or so times--in other words, it is rarely cited, and then usually in the off-hand manner with which those who wish they had influence dismiss those who do. (reagan's speech at the berlin wall is not even mentioned, something hard to fathom in an 800-page history of postwar europe.)    eventually, the anti-american streak which runs through this book from the beginning emerges into plain sight: ""but it should not be concluded...that it was american encouragement or support which precipitated or facilitated their [eastern europe's] liberation."" (p. 631) and then later, equally bluntly, ""...[despite] the self-congratulatory narrative that has entered the american public record, washington did not `bring down' communism, communism imploded of its own accord."" (p. 659.)    really? who would have thought that forty years of american effort in the cold war was just a waste of time?    this proposition is such obvious nonsense that it really does not need to be argued against, but the wonder is that someone who appears to understand the function of economics in history can fail to appreciate the central role of america, and specifically of the american taxpayer, in postwar europe. america paid for europe's reconstruction (marshall plan). america paid for europe's welfare states (by relieving their governments of the need to pay for their own defense, and also in the form of endless credits and loans). america paid for europe's economic prosperity (by bankrolling the agencies which funded it--such as the imf & world bank--and by opening american markets to european goods while allowing european markets to remain subsidized and protected; something that is still the case today, from agriculture to airbus). and finally, it was america who paid for the soviet's defeat. without america, modern europe would not exist.    yes, it is undeniable that communism rotted from the inside. but rot by itself does not cause collapse (otherwise how to explain north korea, a long-bankrupt thugocracy that survived even the death of the former thug-in-chief?) such states continue to exist indefinitely, until given a push. and so to answer judt's own question: the reason communism collapsed when it did was because america pushed. ronald reagan reversed american policy and stood up to the soviets, and did so at a time when the major western european states were cowering in postures of supplication and appeasement (thatcher's uk excepted). it had nothing to do with the helsinki accords.    judt flatters himself in the preface that his book will be controversial, but to this reader his conclusions are too silly to be worthy of controversy. they are simply wrong.    it is a pity judt fails here. the fundamental lesson to be drawn from the history of postwar europe is that it is no good trying to make friends with the schoolyard bully--or to give him your lunch money in order not to get beaten up (the european response). the lesson is that you must stand up to bullies. appeasement in all its guises--rapprochement, ostpolitik, engagement, detente, nixon/kissinger-style scheming, or carter's endless vacillation--inevitably leads to failure. and when the bill finally comes due, as it always does, then the accrued interest can be enormously costly in human life. this was true in munich in 1938, and it remains true today.     given the current state of the world, we could have used a book which reminded us of this basic truth right now.    there are numerous errors and omissions, mostly minor (iceland is missing from the cover maps), occasionally more significant (for example, there is no understanding that the repeated attacks by american hedge funds against the weak european currencies did much more than just blow england and italy out of the erm in 1992. they also forced a hugely embarrassing french devaluation in 1993--in the form of widened intervention bands--and imposed a hitherto unknown market rigor upon the respective governments, basically requiring them to depoliticize monetary policy and rein in fiscal policy--major changes in how these governments governed. the attacks also contributed to the ready adoption of the euro, as a collective defense against george soros.) but any book of this scope will contain errors and omissions; in fact the strength of postwar is its vast collection of facts and figures and statistics (although weakened by the lack of source citations.) it is in the small-scale work of collecting data that judt succeeds. it is in the big-scale work of interpreting those data that he fails. for example, toward the end of the book there is an account of the disaster in the balkans following the break up of yugoslavia. judt correctly identifies the nadir of postwar europe: the slaughter at srebrenica, in which 7400 muslims were murdered under the noses of dutch soldiers serving under un command. he then goes on to contrast the situation when nato took over, at which point the slaughters promptly stopped, and ten years of peace ensued (enduring to this day). surely this is something to which you would ask: why? the answer is simple: the un force, as is usual with un forces, was too small, had a weak and compromised mandate, was composed of soldiers who were inadequately equipped and commanded, and who operated under unrealistic rules of engagement. but the nato force tolerated no nonsense, they came in with the intention of standing up to the serbs, and had the roe to do it. the serb `army' (if thugs who slaughter civilians can be dignified with such a term) promptly collapsed.    same lesson: bullies must be stood up to. perhaps it is the fact that the force was american-led which prevented judt from seeing this.    (at the time of writing, the un is once again dithering in the same old way on the same old issue--this time in lebanon and darfur--a perfect example of why we should learn from the past instead of repeating it, as seems all but inevitable right now. what a sorry institution the un has become!)    judt gives some good detail of postwar political theory on the continent--something usually missing from english-language accounts, other than the obvious observation that such theory was mainly marxist. sartre and camus were predictable, foucault less so (a substantial presence in france, but more or less unknown in america). judt appears to come from the political left himself, but nevertheless he seems not to have understood the basis of foucault (which can be summed up, deep throat-like, as ""follow the power."") in foucaultian terms, the discourse of dissent (which judt claims collapsed communism) was something entirely dictated by the power relations existing at the time. he would have said look not at the surface, look at the constellations (a favorite foucaultian term) of power. any objective survey of the constellations of power existing in europe in 1989 would center on the united states (and might still do so today, despite a united germany, an expanded eu, and the absence of the soviet threat.) in explaining the collapse of communism, historical roads as diverse as euro-marxism, macroï¿½-economics, empirical rationalism or even great man theory all lead to the same place: america. but according to judt, washington had nothing to do with it.    by the final chapters, any pretense of objectivity has been lost. 9/11 was not a watershed horror for the free world, but a passing american event that by implication the us deserved for its middle eastern policy. (of all european leaders since 1945, judt reserves his strongest denunciation not for stalin or tito or ceausescu, but for tony blair. why? blair supports american policy--""blindly,"" of course.) in summing up what (judt thinks) binds europeans together, it is ""...contrast with `the american' way of life.' (p. 748)    lastly, not just the content but the style is likely to be tiresome to american readers. there is an overabundance of smug english circumlocutions and double-negatives: ""it was not for nothing,"" ""not perhaps terribly,"" and the like. meaningless modifiers, such as ""more than a little"" and ""decidedly,"" are used ad nauseum, so that the text sometimes reads like a student essay in which the author has tried padding it out to make the required number or words. judt could learn from the great english historians of the past, of whom there are plenty, from gibbon to churchill. there is in postwar none of their directness of language, that firm relentless empiricism which at its best ascends into epic prose, noble in conception and majestic in scope. it is what makes reading them such a pleasure, whatever they have to say. reading judt is just a chore.    in the end this book, for all its size, is just a sour little pamphlet--an insult to the achievement that it purports to explain. it is the written equivalent of those old photographs of soviet leaders gathered atop lenin's tomb on may day, in which the images of the purged party members have been carefully airbrushed out--except that in postwar, it is not just a party hack but the main player who is missing. postwar is not even bad history, it is non-history, just anti-american propaganda dressed up as scholarship.    it should sell well in france. big history, written small"	0

the best parts of the lost painting: the quest for a caravaggio masterpiece,  by jonathan harr, deal with the artist himself.  when most artists are considered eccentric, caravaggio was a renegade in his actions.  a fighter.  he killed a man, and lived his last years on the run.  many of his paintings were initially discounted, but his popularity grew in later years.  i enjoyed the book, and found the idea of these lost masterpieces, valued in the tens of millions of dollars, to be out there somewhere very fascinating.    four stars & recommended. very interesting read 	2
"this is the first ds book that i have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did i try again???????    can i really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  i wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? i would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.      coop only dates 20 something's.  he has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  this doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident pediatrician, who works in icu with preemies at all, who tells him to ""have her get an abortion"".  a bit too blasï¿½ for me.  coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  i had a hard time getting into this premise.      the way ds totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  i realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for ds. is this book for real?"	0

"this novel in dunning's series about cliff janeway, bookseller sleuth, reads quite rough. it is an easy read because of the unusually large print for a trade paperback, but the plot is disjointed and leaves huge loose ends (and no sign of a sequel). the central section is largely irrelevant to this story and unrequited (but contains a commercial warning to be seriously heeded by booklovers). the good guys and bad guys are caricatures and too easy to spot (with one very key exception), while cliff now is almost bad with simply too hostile a personality. finally, the ending is more hilariously awkward, quick, and sketchy than it is scary or satisfying. ""in a word,"" this novel is rough, unfinished, hasty, indulgent, a discourtesy by author and editor.     dunnings first two janeway mysteries (booked to die & the bookman's wake) were stunningly different, fresh, and invited me into a world of books, while his two o'clock eastern wartime was a fascinating radio/love story. the bookman's promise was strange and now sign of the book is shockingly disappointing. if i happened to read this one first i doubt i would read anothe. disappointing"	2

"this textbook relies on more handwaving arguments than my quantum textbook! griffiths seems to be under the impression that he is an astounding mathematician and the reader can barely integrate. the ""proofs"" of almost every key concept are either fleshed out in ""well suppose... then this might happen..."" or altogether left to the reader. it was a fun challenge to actually write a proof for a lot of them, too... maybe griffiths should have tried it when he wrote the book.  if the reader does every single problem in the book, he or she may have a mid-undergrad level understanding of basic e&m. very little relativity, and no quantum mechanical aspects are covered (if i remember correctly). he needs to learn what a ""proof"" is"	0

the road to serfdom is a book that you see recommended on many reading lists, and for good reason.  hayek shows the reader, from many different directions, why socialism is doomed to failure.  he carefully explains why socialism in its pure form leads, inevitably, to totalitarianism.  hayek's illustrations and explanations are quite clear.      i found myself somewhat challenged by hayek's writing style.  make no mistake, this can be a somewhat difficult book to read.  keep in mind though, that it is a book that should be read a little at a time and pondered upon.  the first chapter seemed to be the most difficult.  if you can make it through the first chapter, then you are home free.    in the end, i was fascinated by this book.  hayek's ability to see in 1944 what became apparent only many years later to most of his contemporaries, is remarkable.  even though this is no easy read, its more than worth the effort. challenging, but worth it!	1
the riftwar was a good saga.  pug was good.  tomas was good.  arutha was good.  everything was good.    then feist came out with this series...    anyone who wants to know the plotline for this one just save yourself the money and read the atlantis attacks comic books by marvel, the eternals by jack kirby, and the fantastic #337-340 and then you'll easily see where feist stole this storyline from.      a dreaming mad god that influences a world around him, that's buried under a mountain, whose thoughts become reality?/a dreaming black celestial from a race of space gods who is buried under a mountain and can control reality around him and is trying to destroy the universe?    c'mon, i can't believe i'm the only who has seen this.  everyone takes ideals from someone, hence tolkien syndrome, but to couple it with this sorry book(ie a stupid book where a stupid pug that throws fireballs but can't dodge them and can't time travel like in other books and can't deal with a minor demon captain)insults the people that made the dreaming celestial(king kirby) and the eternals.  if he was gonna steal ideas, he should have made the entire book worthwhile.    in this book, besides the old guard, erik is the only guy we really care about.  characters that were developed in the two lackluster books before are killed off before they have a chance to sign and we're left with characters like miranda, whom we don't reall any thing for at all.  all in all, a very poor effort in the serpentwar saga.    feist gets an a for stealing storylines and an f for originality.  i'll stick to newer guys like simon r green, aaron mccarty, and ferrenzano for new takes on fantasy/sci fi. feist.....you couldn't do better than steal old marvel comic storylines?	0

i will agree with some that this work can often be confusing in tacitus failure to fully explain new characters as they suddenly appear as if from no where, but the narrative is smooth, never tiresome, and it must be  considered that it was written more than a thousand years ago and has been  left to us in a mutilated form.  despite these small drawbacks tacitus is  still rome's greatest ancient historian and the greatest stylist in the  latin language. considerations	1

perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is the reaction to it by various readers.  those who detested it said it was because of the violence.  those who like it apparently liked it because it was by nora roberts.    there are the usual nora roberts fixtures here:  a beautiful, independent, tough heroine; r-rated sex scenes; handsome and talented lovers; flowers, etc.  it has been touted by some as a mystery of sorts, but there's nothing very mysterious about it.  anyone who doesn't know who the arsonist is after the first fire hasn't paid much attention.  in fact, i kept wanting to tell reena to wake up and go get him.    perhaps the biggest departure from ms. roberts' previous books (for me, at least) is the rather humdrum atmosphere.  ambience is the writer's strongest suit in other works--alaska in winter, an island off boston, chesapeake bay, ireland, louisiana etc.  old baltimore neighborhoods and a pizza shop aren't quite the same.    still, the writing is mostly good and i kept reading.  a second-rate nora roberts book is still more interesting than most other novels being published today. not my favorite	2

this is one of the best books i have read dealing with shakespeare. becuase it has such a specific focus, the year 1599, it is able to take an indepth look at some of shakespeare's best work. the book focuses on some of shakespeare's best plays: julius ceaser, as you like it, and hamlet, but unlike so many other shakesperian analysis he does not look at this only from a literary standpoint shapirio looks at it from a historical view. shapirio chronicles the events in shakespeare's life and in local and global politics that would effect what he was writting in a particular year. this specificity of this topic allows shapirio to fully engage the reader in intresting and unique analysis of very well known plays. though this book is detailed and very focused it is by no means dull. this book is engaging and witty throughout. i would strongly reccomend this to anyone intrested shakespeare or the elizabethan era. an extrodinary year for shakespeare	1

"like the author i can remember the books i read as a child (with great fondness), i have those books even today, and like her they are my old and familiar friends. but unlike her most of those books have been nonfiction, for i thought/think those were the way to see the real world. after reading this book i realize that the gap i thought existed between nonfiction and fiction isn't really important. for she sees books, like i imagine most readers do, as a funny kind of mirror which reflects the reader's inner world at the same time as displaying the author's world. i think the gap is between readers and nonreaders, who like those described this book as visual or picture people, identify with films rather than books.  the book is a memoir which asks the big question on our reading minds-- does it matter if i can't remember what is in the books? she answers it- ""for in the end, even if all my books where to vanish, i would still have them somewhere, if i had read them attentively enough.  maybe the words on the page are not even the true book, in the end only a gateway to the book which recreates in the mind and lasts as long as we do.""   the book is a real treat for anyone who like her, is often asked, ""haven't you wasted your life, by reading rather than experiencing life?""  she answers this with the thought that her life is so intertwined with the books she has read and thereby experienced, and so made a part of her. that it doesn't matter, which is books and which is real life for they together make her, her. it's a good book, short, poignant with echoes and parallels apparent to any readers life. go for it, spend a pleasant hour with this book. a dying world?"	1

"in the society of the muslim brothers, richard p. mitchell addresses the ideology of the organization. he takes the reader from the birth of the movement that would eventually challenge the egyptian government to it's greatest and worst moments. he writes with an amazingly objective style, neither apologizing for the members who committed crimes, nor minimalizing the excellent social welfare contributions of hassan al-banna, the leader. of particular interest in this discussion of dualities is the point made about the dual legal systems. al-banna felt that the western laws ""corrupted and perverted the nation's thought, mind and logic.""  mitchell's point on this seems to hold vivid clarity in the idea that manmade laws and shari'a are innately incompatible. the inharmonious combination of this dual legal system ""served to shatter the `unity' of the nation."" mitchell's writing really catches the essence of a group of people struggling to come to terms with a rapidly changing society in flux in a rapidly changing world. his book was translated into arabic and arab scholars agree that his portrayal of this politically powerful religious movement is academically sound. objective, direct, accurate: excellent"	1

"one of the missing components to the concept of teaching ""social skills"" to children and young adults on the autism spectrum, is that instructors focus on textbook manners instead of teaching real life practical knowledge. the hidden curriculum explains that every society has unstated rules, the things that no one explains to you, but which you are supposed to pick up somehow on your own. remember how awkward and geeky most of us were in jr. high? and there were always the ""cool kids"" who somehow knew just how to dress, just what to say and meanwhile you (and i) were clueless? it's because they understood the unstated rules, they had an unkanny ability to pick up the exact tools necessary for ""coolness."" as we grow up, we learn better how to adapt to social situations, we know how to behave in a variety of settings, even perhaps cross culturally. adults grow into a sense of ease in our surroundings, we know what we are supposed to do. now, imagine that you never got over that awkward phase, you were perpetually spending your life roaming around trying to figure out the world with little to go on. no one pulled you aside and explained, ""this is how it is, kid."" that's exactly what it's like for our kids on the spectrum. well, here comes the hidden curriculum to the rescue! not only does it explain many of these ""unstated rules"" (many of which are humorous--who doesn't know you should take tuna in your school lunch because it stinks? many of our as kids!) it also goes beyond to explain how to uncover them. it highlights how crucial it is for us as parents, as educators and just as a society to literally pull our as folks aside and say, ""these are the rules."" for example, ""don't pick your nose."" good advice right? but p-leeeze, everybody picks their nose! (okay, not me, but everybody else! :-) what we really need to teach our kids is not, don't pick your nose, but not to pick their nose where people can see them. sound silly? our children and friends on the autism spectrum just need for us to teach them one little tidbit like this every day and they'll find their way with increasing ease. and wouldn't you have liked someone to pull you aside in jr. high and done the same for you? let's equip our kids with the real skills to make their way in the world. the hidden curriculum does just that!. finally! a simple solution!"	1
the relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and i failed to connect to the main character, lottie, at all.  the book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  there were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness. a long book that seems to get longer as you read it	2

"first, let me say that i am a very independent, very headstrong, liberal wife who has a higher education than her husband (masters' degree), owns a business and takes no b.s. from anyone.  when this book came out, i truly thought it was a joke.  who would write a book like this outside of the 1950s?!  and where is the ""proper care... of wives""?!  to add 'insult', a coworker of my husband (whose wife stays at home with their 4 kids because they feel that this is the role wives are supposed to take on), is the one who offered to lend it to me.  i thought, ""this will be interesting"" but can't criticize until giving it a shot, right???    ok - there's the background - here's the review:    i couldn't put the book down and read it in a just over a day.  while i don't agree 100% with all that dr. laura says, and as another reviewer commented that there are parts that men may find insulting, this book has changed my life, and as a result it has changed my husband's life - both for the better.  after 7 years of marriage, we are clicking like we never have before.  i can't explain it to you, or to my married best friends whose jaws dropped as i confessed to them over margaritas that i not only read the book but i loved the book.      all i can say is that the foundation makes sense.  it doesn't bash working women - dr. laura is one, after all.  but it does point out, not so discreetly, that your family - the family you have chosen to create - should come above all else.  and that the extremism of some aspects of the feminist movement is self-destructive to women, men and society as a whole.    and as i turned each page and as i tried to rebel against some parts (i shouldn't burden him with the tales of my day??!), peel away the layers, let down your defenses and let it make sense.  (it isn't that my day is less significant, but men and women communicate differently - vent to him about your day and he'll feel like a second class citizen and a failure for not being able to fix your stress.  vent to your girlfriends and they'll dish with you!  focus your time on your husband, family, relationship, etc., once you get home instead.)  and let me tell ya once you leave the work day at the door, your home becomes your home again, too.  so it's win-win!  really!!!    dr. laura's book includes parts and pieces of past calls and letters, which is a helpful, practical demonstration of her points and breaks things up so you don't feel like you're getting a lecture (especially if you are ready to admit you've been doing a few thngs wrong!).  and as you can see the lightbulb go on with average janes all over the country and across time in the dialogue- from them pushing back on her advice to (aha!) getting her message during their conversations, you see the pettiness we can cling to and frankly, the underlying simplicity in each of her messages.    ok - still skeptical? then rent it at the library for free and give it a shot.  just try to put her ideas into practice - commit to changing for a week (if you aren't sold on changing your life)... what's the worst that can happen?  if it's all wrong for you, you have just lost a quick week and you can pat yourself on the back for being right and you can write your own book. ;-)    but just think - what if it works?!  then you will find a new meaning in your life that you didn't know you were missing.  you will have a much happier and rewarding marriage.  your husband will adore you.  (sounds rough, huh?)      trust me - i'm not about to become a submissive, mindless person rather than an equal partner in a relationship.  but as i made a few minor tweaks in how i treat the man i chose to marry and spend the rest of my life with, i have received rewards from him 10-fold.  and to think i thought i was doing it 'right' all along. ;0). stunned (in a good way)"	1

"i like the overall point of this book. i also agree with a lot of the stuff he teaches in regards to using real estate and owning your own business as the only true way to get superb rates of returns. however, he does make one huge assumption in the real estate section that is not clear: that you can rent a house for the same cost as your expenses. this may work in some cheaper areas, but in the places where houses have skyrocketed in price, expecting to get a high enough rent to cover all the fees is not realistic for some major areas. also, he makes it sound like getting 150k is easy for a salary. unfortunately for those of us in stable ""normal"" fields like engineering, nursing, accounting, etc... asking for a 30% raise would get you a lot of laughs at best. nonetheless, i would still recommend it to other new grads. pretty good read. leaves out lots of the details."	2
"i don't feel that miller made much of an attempt to prove that anna was in fact a ""good"" mother. like another reviewer said, i don't think she was a bad mother, but the book really didn't go into much detail about anna's relationship with molly (especially up until anna' ex-husband filed for custody) and instead focused on anna's life experiences and psyche. after brian said he wouldn't send molly back, anna didn't even seem that concerned about molly's mental and emotional well-being. she just focused on her notion that leo's actions were simply taken out of context, and while she wanted to see molly again, i got the impression that it was based on a selfish concern for her ""rights"" as a mother, not out of a concern for her daughter.     and what was so great about leo anyway?? he wasn't exactly nice to anna, often condescending to her, and from the beginning i felt that his affection for molly was a farse, simply to stay on anna's good side. he also seemed sexually possessive of anna--like the scene when he kept having sex with her after molly came into the bed because of a nightmare. i think anna loved her daughter, but she made the error of confusing sexual attraction with true love, since she had never felt such an attraction before. as a result, her daughter became an afterthought to someone she had known for 2 months, with dire consequences. although she did show some signs of remorse, she spent a large amount of time trying to justify her actions instead of showing a very deep concern for her daughter's welfare. if she had put her daughter first from the beginning, instead of being swept up into a sexual frenzy and creating illusions about the new ""family"" she and leo were forming, then she probably never would have lost custody of her child. was she really that good of a mother?"	2
i really did love his collaboration with deepak on living beyond miracles, but i am beginning to grow tired of hearing the same stuff. if you want original and someone who is a gifted writer and humble man, deepak is so much more of a deep thinker. i get really tired of hearing wayne regurgitate other people's work. it is as if he doesn't have an original thought without quoting someone else's work.   and when he told the audience thank you for him being able to buy a house on maui, i was actually a little bit offended in that i felt sorry for the audience. (i saw this on pbs) at first, they laughed and then they actually looked sad after he said it. i have heard him do this in every single audio work i have listened to in some way or another, and it is truly full of the ego he tells us to get away from.   i know we're all human, but there always seems to be a sting in his work that shows how big his head really is. too bad! without it, he could change so many more people's lives. he really thinks himself sincere, but his ego keeps getting in the way!	0

"by setting her story in manhattan, among the literary elite, claire messud might have imagined she was giving her readers an updated version of tom wolfe's ""bonfire of the vanities,"" which described upper-class life in manhattan among the wall street elite, so exquisitely that character descriptions from his 1987 book (""master of the universe"" and ""social skeleton"") became part of our vocabulary.    claire messud is no tom wolfe.  ""the emperor's children"" describes a circle of ambitious young adults who alternately worship and plot the overthrow of ""the emperor,"" a famous writer.  unlike ""bonfire of the vanities,"" this book has no compelling narrative - the ""voice"" shifts from one character to the next and the story ambles along as these young adults try to figure out what they want, who they need and who they love or hate and why.  trust me, you won't care.  meanwhile, the ""emperor"" lopes along as a literary lion past his prime.  the characters become entangled in a mess of betrayals (the ""emperor"" betrays his wife with his daughter's best friend, the daughter betrays her father by marrying the man who would dethrone the ""emperor"" etc. etc.) -- and all the mess just goes away after the attacks on september 11, 2001.  but we never learn how september 11 affected messud's characters - she uses that fateful day as an excuse to bring the curtain down on this stupid story going nowhere. claire messud is no tom wolfe"	2
"""the last river - the tragic race for shangri-la"".......tragic. yes i'd agree that this book is tragic.  tragic that i bothered reading it.....tragic that i paid for it in order to read it.....tragic that todd wasted his time writing it......tragic that i disliked it so much that i can be bothered writing a review.  the warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket. ""advance praise for the last river"" it reads. in retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it.  it seems that todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be, and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal. so much of the content has so little relevancy to the story, that you soon tire trawling through it.  this was my third tsango experience. i do recommend the outside documentary on the lindgren expedition. ""hell or high water"" is not outstanding, but is worth a read, but on this book, my advise to todd is please make this the last river that you drag through the wringer. a tragedy indeed...."	2
first the good news. this book contains some of heinlein's most interesting speculations, some of his most delightfully outlandish ideas (there is a cat who really can dematerialize and walk through walls, and enough skewed gender politics and sexual antics to give the book an x rating :-)), some of his most interesting characters (several of them new, and many old, such as lazarus long and jubal harshaw), and probably the most well developed presentation of the concept of the world as myth. heinlein uses this idea to tie together the different books, such as glory road, stranger in a strange land, and the number of the beast, that are not a part of his future history series, by making them all members of the multiple timeline universe, or multiverse theory, that was discovered by mathematician dr. jake burroughs in the number of the beast. it's a brilliant concept that unifies heinlein's entire oeuvre under one integrating theory of temporal reality.    now the bad news. the novel is very uneven and much of the action doesn't seem to go anywhere, as dr. ames and hilda get chased from pressure dome to pressure dome on luna, finally ending up at time corps headquarters in another millenium. even worse, the ending is possibly the most unsatisfactory of any heinlein novel as it leaves the entire novel's story and denouement unfinished, perhaps because heinlein intended to follow the book up with another novel. but as that never happened here it just ends in the middle of the action and there is nothing more to indicate how the story actually ends.     half way through the book, it takes off in an unexpected direction (although that's part of the fun, since that's where you get to meet all the other characters from past novels), and is where one finally learns that this novel is subsumed under heinlein's temporal multiverse concept. still, there is little to motivate that based on the previous direction of the book. the hard-hitting, in your face, ultra-cool, smarter-than-you dialog that is one of heinlein's trademarks, is so ubiquitous in the book so as to make it impossible to distinguish many secondary character's personalities from one another, as they all act and talk and think the same way--which is basically how gwen novak and dr. richard ames behave too.     finally, almost everyone in the book is apparently a completely larcenous, opportunistic, and immoral entrepreneur who would sell his own grandmother to the glue factory if he could get away with it, especially the citizens of luna, who are proudly anarchistic, and who ardently believe that there ain't no such thing as a free lunch. but apparently that means it's okay to steal someone else's lunch if you can get away with it. after awhile this never ending procession of unrepentent and ebullient scalawags, rogues, and profiteers gets to be a little tedious, and seems to indicate a darkening of heinlein's views on human nature which first became evident in his novel, friday.    the novel is still well worth reading for heinlein fans, but only if you're familiar with many previous characters, concepts, and history from earlier works. at a minimum, this would include methuselah's children, the green hills of earth, the moon is a harsh mistress, stranger in a strange land, the number of the beast, glory road, and possibly a few more that i'm forgetting. so if you're a newcomer to heinlein, don't start with this book; start with the many better introductions to his fiction, such as those recommended on several websites developed to his work. if you do a google search on his name, you'll turn up several of these. the book assumes too much previous special knowledge to be comprehensible to the heinlein beginner, and reading this one could turn someone off who might otherwise enjoy heinlein with a little more knowledge and education.    all that having been said, the book is still worth reading, especially for heinlein fans, since in this novel heinlein fully develops the theory of the world as myth that he introduced in the number of the beast. another strong point, for all those lazarus long fans, is that lazarus has a major role. and in the last part of the book, some of heinlein's most memorable characters from previous books, such as jubal harshaw, slipstick libby, mannie davis, rufus and star (from glory road) hazel stone, jake burroughs, and others appear, and it's fun to have all of them in one place at temporal headquarters interacting together. uneven but still worth reading	2

this is a great story in context - the year is 2002, the author is switching from being a hedge fund manager to a full-time journalist and tv prognosticator.  he's a branding machine, so the book contains a lot of self-promotion.  you see jim the hyper, jim the genius and jim the buffoon - all part of the brand.    the biography takes you from jim at harvard, to jim the homeless journalist to jim the financier to jim the hedge fund operator.  jim fesses up to a lot of the personal problems that he caused for himself along the way, writing in the same style he rants on tv.  as such, the story carries the same fast pace as the tv.  even if you don't like him, you'll keep reading.     is this a book on how to make $ in the stock market?  not really - there are much better out there.  is this the definitive biography on cramer?  that probably won't be written until after his lact act.  will this help you understand the guy sweating, screaming and pulling his hair out in the lightning round?  absolutely. great story in context	1
so ... i now learn that the infertility problems i had for many years, which i always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were actually due to the fact that i hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood.  and my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood.  and, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as dr. northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.     there is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid avoidable problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong. offensive, 'blame the victim' tripe	2

"it was mark twain who popularized the aphorism of benjamin disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.  i kept hearing all these marvelous things about freakonomics, a book by steven levitt and stephen dubner, so when i ran across it at 25% off, i did a stupid freakin' thing and bought it.  i thought, what the freak, i've got a pretty inquisitive mind and i'm open to seeing things differently, to discovering new viewpoints.    the doubt started early when i got the book home and i first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of time, the new york times, the washington post, and the los angeles times.  when all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is, i'm immediately going to be freakin' suspicious.  author malcolm gladwell tells us on the cover, ""prepare to be dazzled.""  well, evidently ol' malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than i am.  (i won't even mention the smug mug of stephen dubner that taunted me from the book's dust jacket because i don't want you to get the idea that i judge a book by its cover.  or in this case, a writer by his physiognomy.  so i won't mention that.)    if you're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver's home, then you just might be dazzled by freakonomics.  if i tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts, thinking that it is cutting costs, is probably increasing its overhead, and this fact astounds you  - if you must ask ""but how?"" - then yes, buy freakonomics and be dazzled.  mostly what freakonomics offers (when its conclusions can be trusted) is just what we used to call ""common sense.""  but since america has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent, brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of survivors, and american idols, and lost knuckleheads, good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead (when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands, that is).    i dove into freakonomics hoping to find my purchase worthwhile.  i got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized: everything would require second-guessing and verifying.  on that page, smug mug tells us (based on a single report by the institute of medicine) that ""drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health.""  fortunately, i read your body's many cries for water by doctor f. batmanghelidj over a decade ago so i already knew what a bunch of bunk that was.    in chapter 4, smug mug ""proves"" that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the roe v. wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate.  this represents the centerpiece of his book, both literally and ideologically.  the first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s.  on page 92, the author acknowledges that the police in atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 olympics.  well, would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted?  true, being honest might be means to an increased budget, but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control.  and surely the chamber of commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception.  let me ask, do you actually feel you're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s?  that's funny, me neither.  there's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported, and recently, an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now.    in dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime (if this claim is a verity), dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10% of the drop.  having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian, it's funny that i find myself even contending with the stats smug mug uses that actually work against his theory: i believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10% - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly.  and dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws ""simply don't bring down crime.""  (be sure to read the utterly fascinating book, gunfighters, highwaymen & vigilantes by roger d. mcgrath, for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint!)    in dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion, i didn't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s, and i wonder if that might have some statistical bearing.  ya think?   yes, i think smug mug is selective.  he calls some abortions a ""crude and drastic sort of insurance policy.""  not ""immoral.""  not ""sinful.""  but then i didn't expect smug mug to call a sin a sin.      and even if levitt and dubner's hypothesis is correct, that abortions have lowered crime, the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person, but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered.  so why are we even discussing this?  i'll tell you why: because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus, and now they're pulling out all the stops, trying to ""statistically"" convince the masses that they're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing.  i find this repulsive!  (and there are studies indicating that those missing people have, and will continue to have, a negative economic impact on society.)    i won't even go into chapter 5, what makes a perfect parent?  suffice to say that as usual (surprise! surprise!) all the statistics dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue.  funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs.  just know that if you're a working mother, you haven't cheated your child in the least, but if you're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order, you are ""unenlightened.""  if your kid is watching lots of tv, it isn't turning the ""child's brain to mush.""  (no word on whether or not it's turning his/her morals to mush though.)  and the studies (that we are called to pay attention to) show ""that a child's character wasn't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care, whether he had one parent or two, whether his mother worked or didn't, whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each.""  (i've often wondered what might have happened to me if my mom, who was home most of the time, hadn't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day, year after year, while i was growing up in the `60s and `70s.)    i've given freakonomics two stars because i did find the section on the naming of children very interesting, as well as the story of stetson kennedy's fight against the ""three ks.""  but if you're smarter than i am, you'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it.  economically speaking, that's just ""common cents."". lies, damned lies, and statistics"	2
i was having alot of problems and none of the several doctors and one specialist i tried knew what to do with me.  i bought several thyroid books, but this one answered all of my questions.  the author is eminently qualified to write this book, and has done so in a readable and down to earth, yet detailed way.  thyroid problems can affect every aspect of your life in ways you might not imagine--you need to be well informed and this book will do it. the best of them all!	1
this is by far the most useless book on the subject of the state of education.  for instance, while the authors make much of the relative stability of sat scores, they ignore the decline in scores from the naep, ctbs, and mat scores (to name a few) from the same period.  they also keep silent about the fact that calculators were once forbidden from the math portion of the sat, playing a role no doubt in said stability.  dr. lawrence stedman, an associate professor of education at the state university of new york at binghamton, ph.d. in educational policy studies, and self-decribed progressive &quot;sympathetic to their concerns,&quot; wrote an article in the peer-reviewed education policy analysis archives. he pointed out numerous examples of the fudging-- whether out of duplicity or incompetence, you judge-- of &quot;facts&quot; to support the authors' farcical claims, and where such claims went unsupported. in other words, while criticism usually comes from &quot;the enemy,&quot; one of their own blasted this book for its inaccuracies.  since it could not possibly have been written with a straight face, i recommend spending your money on something written with more integrity.  there is a real crisis in education, there are manufacturers, and this book rolled straight off their assembly line. straight from two of the manufacturers	0

the first time i saw this movie, there was one scene which scared me; the scene where mary's parents are dying from the plague (i think it was cholera?). the music they use for this can send chills down someone's back; i know because it did mine.    apart from that, i loved the movie. i don't know why they had to have dickon killed, though. (ben weatherstaff and mary talk at the end of the movie; we find out that dickon was killed in the war.)    i like how colin and mary meet at the end and how mary held off on saying yes to colin's marriage proposal until they were together in the garden.     something else i'm wondering: was this movie set during world war 1 or world war 2?. apart from one scene scaring me, i loved this movie.	1
i have always been fascinated with dr. king as one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century. i love the work that dr. dyson did in writing this book, because he is authentic in talking about dr. king the man - strengths, weaknesses and all - while exposing the myths about him. being african-american, i can understand why many within our community woud want to scold dr. dyson for exposing dr. king's dirty laundry. i, however, consider it not only essential, but relevant that we talk about the true humanity of our leaders (espcially one as esteemed as dr. king) to avoid the danger of us elevating them as idols. it is a great reminder that god uses people (albeit flawed people) for magnificent works in a fallen world. this is a great book that i highly recommed!. fascinating	1
"finally, a reference book that offers its users more sophisticated word choices in a format that makes such inherent sense!  peter meltzer's book stands out in the way that he differentiates his thesaurus from other, heretofore, conventional ones.  the rogets of the world, as meltzer states, ""start out with the premise that the user already knows the synonyms,"" and their guidebooks merely help to ""jog his or her memory.""  meltzer's book provides its users with new, sophisticated synonyms which, importantly, are neither archaic nor obsolete.  in fact, nearly every synonym is followed by an example of its usage that is taken from actual articles or books, which is fascinating.  additionally, meltzer offers what he calls ""clarifiers"" to 75% of his entries.  these clarifiers amplify the single word you may be seeking.  for example, there are seven uses for ""unusual,"" each with its own specific synonym that more aptly describes ""unusual"", as in unusual/unconventional, unusual/supernatural, unusual/person, etc.  don't expect to find the simple synonyms that you're used to seeing in other thesauri.  meltzer gives you the benefit of the doubt that you already know those words and offers you a more exciting, more intelligent way to shape your vocabulary.  regardless of your writing needs, this book is a must-have.  i enjoyed reading the introduction, it gave me a strong sense of  the book's layout and reminded me why a thesaurus is not just for writing college term papers. sophisticated alternatives, indeed!"	1
"though mr. steyn does have strong opinions and some good observations, his judgements are tainted by an anti-gay bias (he titles one chapter ""the fags"", and it's not meant affectionately).  his readings of stories such as the reaction of lorenz hart upon hearing ""oklahoma"" in a blackout could have been better informed by further research, and he repeats lerner's silly comment about lorenz hart being to short to be heterosexual so he had to turn to men.  the book is also dated in many respects including the waning influence of british operettas and the public's acceptance of stephen sondheim.  rather than this book i would reccommend anything by ethan mordden or martin gottfried. what good there is undermined by bigotry"	0

i was disappointed with my purchase.   the first two tapes in the series were fine, but when i inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  i checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  i, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  i wonder if these products were seconds or something?  i would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world. loose sprockets on cassettes	0
"i am not a neurologist but have a strong personal interest in epilepsy. i read this book with great care. there are many chapters of significant merit including chapters 10-20. these chapters include the seizure taming effects of relaxation and certain types of music, doing things to prevent seizure progression when an aura is felt, lots of general information on epilepsy that is organized on a gender or age basis, the challenges of finding employment, and advice on a whole host of life issues that people with epilepsy often face. these are even more thoroughly covered in a number of other references which i have also read that come from the medical community.     so here is the real issue; what is in chapters 1-9? these chapters are loaded with information on diet, food supplements, vitamins, minerals, oriental medicine and other alternative and complementary approaches to treating epilepsy. as i read the forward by russell blaylock md and chapters 1-9 i had a growing sense that the author's thesis or belief is that traditional american medical treatment of epilepsy on the whole may do more harm than good and should be avoided if possible and that the natural approach is without risk and should be used preferentially. the real problem with this philosophy is that there are many people out there that will believe such nonsense. any natural approach has risks as well as possible (if unproven) benefits. i certainly do not want to deny that there are problems associated with traditional medical treatment of epilepsy. side effects are a real issue and can not be ignored.    the book has many unsubstantiated assertions that would make people think that the medical profession as a whole is uninformed. that is most unfortunate. here is one example from the forward;     (""doctors in general have difficulty with biochemistry in medical school......if your doctors do not understand these molecular events how can they efficiently treat your disorder? in addition to this lack of knowledge......"" p. iv     chapter 1 is a testimonial by the author on how she dealt with her epilepsy by eliminating junk food from her diet, switching to wholesome foods, adding herbs to the mix (skullcap and goldenseal), exercising and losing weight. she also decreased the amount of phenobarbital she was taking. at that point she endorses a definition of drugs as being ""poison(s)."" the reader is also introduced to robert fried ph.d. (a neuropsychologist?) dr. fried allegedly has come to the conclusion that ""seizures are metabolical, (sic) not neurological."" dr. fried also allegedly feels that seizures are more like a regulatory body-process, like vomiting, rather than a disease process. the seizures are, allegedly according to the author, in a way readjusting the individual's metabolism to attempt to achieve homeostasis. my understanding is that there are some seizures that have a metabolic origin but they are in the minority. certainly eating better and taking care of one's body should make a difference in overall health. whether that will cure epilepsy is far from proven.     chapter 4 starts by stating that if you have seizures it is imperative that you see a physician. that is good advice. an implication is made that hypoglycemia may be a major cause of seizures. such an assertion (""major cause"")is a little bit irresponsible in my opinion. it is correctly pointed out that anticonvulsants can have long-term adverse effects on calcium metabolism and bone health. it is then pointed out that phenytoin (an increasingly infrequently used old line anticonvulsant) contains ""drano"" and ""antifreeze."" puleeeze give us a break.  most readers should know better than to believe that. the real problem with this book as i see it is that there are people out there that will actually believe these assertions that are thrown in for effect, and may avoid the medical profession and thus deny themselves of the benefits that modern medical science has to offer. i in fact know of one mother that read this book four years ago and then took her daughter off of her medication feeling that it was too toxic to tolerate. the daughter's seizures that had been completely controlled for 9 months returned after 3 weeks and have never been under good control since then, in spite of restarting and then trying other medications. a reference should have been included, to the important studies that show that people that achieve complete control on medication for at least 2 or 4 years, have a high likelihood (better than 50/50) of not needing medications after that point, but that those that go off medication early and relapse are often difficult to control. on the whole this book is not balanced and this is one example where the other side of the picture should have been presented.     chapter 5 on nutrition is interesting and useful. it is smart to eat right.     a lot of chapter 6, ""foods that harm"" makes sense.     chapter 7 ""foods that heal"" has some interesting ideas. there is information on food supplements as well. i think a more scientific approach to the use of food supplements could have been taken. the issue of the blood brain barrier is not dealt with. there are many unsubstantiated assertions in this chapter. the section on gaba is a good example of both of these problems. gaba does not cross the blood brain barrier and so orally ingested gaba will not end up in the central nervous system. the section ends by stating that ""daily supplementation of 500 to 1,000 mg of gaba has been shown to help prevent seizures."" this is an irresponsible statement, that if taken and followed, could cost the individual several hundred dollars a year, and all for naught.     chapter 8 is about the ketogenic diet. although it can help in those with seizures that are particularly difficult to control, i think that most neurologists would not routinely recommend it. the chapter fails to point out the downside of the ketogenic diet and fails to point out that it will not work unless the patient is truly ketotic. adding fats to a regular diet to try and achieve some of the benefits of the ketogenic diet will only result in weight gain, elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides, and possibly exacerbation of seizures. studies have shown that simply losing weight correlates with better seizure control.     chapter 9 on herbs is interesting but readers should look to other sources before investing a small fortune on those options. a recent book by orrin devinsky, md takes a critical look at herbs (and other alternative and complementary methods of approaching epilepsy) and cites relevant scientific literature (if it exists) that confirms the value of various herbs.    on the whole i do not feel that this is a balanced book. nor do i feel that the author intended for it to be a balanced book. the sources cited as experts are too dominated by acquaintances of the author and not enough is cited from peer review scientific literature. there are far too many unsubstantiated assertions. actually following some of the advice in the book could lead to lost opportunities to get epilepsy under control and could lead to much expense in search of the often elusive goal of effectively treating epilepsy without medication. i cannot recommend this book. i can recommend dr. devinsky's book ""complementary and alternative therapies for epilepsy.""  it is a bit pricy so i recommend borrowing it from your local library unless you are a physician or a hopeless book collector that likes to buy medical texts. i give this book 2 stars because it does have some useful information. the other stuff unfortunately brings it down to a ""2."". be careful when reading this book"	2
"robert a. heinleins novel ""starship troopers"" still creates controversy, generations after it was first published. indeed, the well-known movie ""starship troopers"" was actually a veiled criticism of the book!     is heinlein's book racist or fascist? is it a cold war allegory? is it anti-democratic and militarist? how does this novel square with heinlein's reputation for being a libertarian and near-hippie? these questions are still being hotly debated.     ""starship troopers"" describe a future society in which only people who have served in the military enjoy full citizenship rights. only honorably discharged soldiers have the right to vote and run for office. strangely enough, the non-citizens enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of worship and the right to start businesses. heinlein's future society thus looks like modern america, but with a marine corps-like military caste superimposed on top. in the novel, humanity wages a never-ending war against several races of intelligent space aliens, including the collectivist arachnids, who resemble spiders. many people take the arachnids to be a symbol for communism in general or red china in particular. imperial japan is another possibility.     heinlein's novel attempts to solve that ancient question: how can a society make sure that the best people serve in office? this question is particularly acute in democracies, where anyone can stand for office, and everyone can vote. heinlein's solution is to limit the franchise to those who have served in the military. in this way, only the best are selected for the job. and those willing to put their lives on the line must be the best. but does that really solve the problem?     a military is not necessarily a good administrator or politician. the best in times of peace might be different from the best in times of war. heinlein's system only works if a total and never-ending war is raging. indeed, the war against the arachnids certainly seem to be such. but if so, it's naive to expect freedom of speech or extensive rights for non-citizens. the system would become a military dictatorship pure and simple, like in the movie ""starship troopers"".     the soldiers in the novel are probably inspired by the philosopher-kings and guardians of plato's ""republic"". after rigorous military training, the officers are given courses in moral philosophy, history and politics. but there are also similiarities with ancient athenian democracy. every citizen of ancient athens was expected to serve in the army or navy. there was a connection between rights and duties. but note that many non-citizens in athens were slaves!     ultimately, ""starship troopers"" is unconvincing, even naive. you simply cannot give political power to the military, no matter how the military is recruited, and expect everything else to stay the same. controversial but naive "	2
i found this book to be offensively un-american.  the characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts.  the best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises.  i think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters. anti-american screed offensive	0
just in case you had any doubts, this collection of essays (dating from 1968 to 1999) is clearly a major archive of achievement, demonstrating stroud's preminence in american philosophy. here is his articles in epistemology, which touch upon various topics: foundationialism, scepticism, and transcendental arguments. stroud pays close attention to the challenges philosophical scepticism offers any theory of knowledge, and highlights just how skepticism is a serious problem in contemporary philosophy.  he is also careful to argue for the &quot;invulnerability&quot; of certain thoughts and experiences. an excellent collection...	1

i had seen a few tv movie adaptations of danielle steel's novels but never got the time to reading any of her books. so i finally decide to get `the gift', seeing that it would be a short read, just to give her books a try. i must say that i loved reading this book, and have already bought other books of hers to add to my bookshelf.    5 year old annie whittaker died of meningitis, the day after christmas, leaving a bruise on the rest of the family: tommy, her brother; elizabeth, her mother; and john, her father. each member of the family slowly secludes themselves from one another in their own way. what used to be a close knit family doesn't exist now. meanwhile, we are introduced to maribeth robertson, a 16 year old girl who makes a mistake that would change her life. she runs away from her family and friends, and starts working in a restaurant as a waitress, where she meets tommy. the two immediately hit it off, but there are a lot of problems standing in their way which they must face.    the story is very sweet, and we get to read how maribeth changes the whittakers and makes them a family again. though the ending is a little sad, you feel touched by the story overall. danielle steel, famous of writing matters of the heart, does an excellent job in depicting the love between two lovers, between a mother and a daughter, and the love within the family.     whether you are a fan of danielle steel or not, if you like reading romantic novels, then this book will be a perfect `gift' for you. touching story	1

"im not really writing this review to sway anyone's opinion of it.  tastes are different from person to person.  some may love this book, others may hate it, and a few will think its okay, that is just the way things are.  i only wanted to share my opinion about it, because oddly enough it stirs up strong emotions within me whenever i think about it.  the first time i read this book i hated it.  i have read it again since then and upon finshing it twice i still don't like this book at all.  yet, during both times that i read it i could not put the book down.  this is the bizarre duplicitous nature of the relic.  i do not like the story or the characters, but still i have been drawn in.  as much as i hate to admit it i consider this book to be a real page-turner.      i don't think i need to go into the plot so i will list the offenses this book commits (once again this is just my opinion).    predictability - i dont think i was surprised even once while reading this book.  it gives you the kind of cut and pasted characters that are far to overused these days.  from the first time a character is introduced you can pretty much tell whether they are in it for the long haul, or merely here to serve as entree's for the monster.  the outcome of most of the situations presented are easily deciphered if given any thought at all.  not to spoil any surprises but i'll give you one guess what happens when we are informed that the museum the beast haunts has a security system with solid metal doors that fall into place to cut off a supposed thief's escape route.  throw in the fact that we are informed of this right before a gala premier of the museums' new attraction in which hundreds of guests will be attending and...well i think you allready know where this is going.    poor characters -  all your cliche's are here.  from the overworked, underappreciated heroine, who puts all the pieces together, to the museums management staff who refuse to shut down the museums' premier even after numerous, grisly murders.  why? do you ask.  because of revenues of course. i wonder if the museums' head director wears the same suits as the mayor from the movie jaws.  if the characters arent fulfilling the role as a needed cliche' then they are doing the exact opposite that any sane person would do.  if i heard strange noises in a closed section of the museum i was gaurding, especially after the fact that at least two horrific murders were commited in the vicinity, i would call for backup before i investigated.  of course i am sane, so reverse what i would have done and you get the basic course of action most of the people in this book take.    unbelievability -  there were many times while reading this book when i had to stop and say, ""give me a break.""  i also used the expressions, ""oh, please"", and ""that is so stupid!"".  many times we are expected to deny common sense, and reason so that the story can progress.  of course if you had a monster that could be killed like any other animal on this planet, then this book would probably only be 100 pages long.  so in an effort to stretch it out to 400 or so pages you need a creature that can be described as nothing short of the animal equivalent of a sherman tank.  im not kidding, this monkey-lizard is shot no less than 5 times and probably a great deal more with no ill effects.  i don't want to give anything more away, but there will be many times when you will find something hard to believe in this book.    many ""what a rip-off"" moments - to often while reading this book i found myself comparing it to some other book or movie that had come before it.  there is a reason so many people compare this book to jurrasic park, many plot points and supposed surprises seem to be taken right out of chricton's book.  so instead of putting the quote ""far above chricton's jurassic park"" on the cover of the relic, i would have put ""not above taking ideas from better books"".  put jurrasic park, congo, and jaws in a blender and you have the relic. this ""borrowing"" of ideas seems so bad at times that i wouldnt be surprised if for every copy of the relic sold micheal chricton received royalties.    once again i feel compelled to mention that for all its stupidity, and predictability, i could not put this book down.  for that reason alone this book is probably worth reading, and sharing with your friends.  then you can all sit down and compare notes on how many times you each found an instance where you found yourself thinking of another, probably better, book. an interesting mix of good and bad."	2

around the world in eighty days, by jules verne, is a novel set in 1872, when technical revolutions allow a man to travel around the world in eighty days.  but, to all the members of the reform club but one, this is only correct theoretically.  however, to mr. phileas fogg, this is a practical number.  he then wagers twenty thousand pounds that he can make the journey.    so mr. fogg and his newly acquired servant, passepartout, immediately set out for their first stop- suez.  there they encounter a detective named fix, who has heard news of a robber that fits mr. fogg's description exactly.  fix, wanting the reward of five percent of the fifty-five thousand pounds stolen, makes it his business to stop the `criminal' at all costs.  fix, believing that the wager is just a ruse to get the cops off his tail, thinks that mr. fogg will not follow through with this journey around the world.    all goes smoothly, seeing as fix is unable to attain a warrant for mr. fogg's arrest, until the railway that they are traveling on from bombay to calcutta, much to their surprise, is unfinished!  fortunately, thanks to mr. fogg's cunning ways, the party is able to buy an elephant to travel the fifty miles to the next railway station.    on the way to the next railway station at allahabad, they see a young woman being carried by indian savages.  an acquaintance, sir francis, explains that she is going to be sacrificed.  mr. fogg, having gained twelve hours, decides to save the woman from a painful death.    aouda, as it turns out, is royalty to a village in india.  but, since the savages will stop at nothing to find her, it becomes necessary to take her to her cousin in hong kong, which is conveniently one of the stops on mr. fogg's journey.  but, much to the party's dismay, the relative has moved to europe.    fix, hoping to delay the party, gets passepartout knocked out on opium, keeping the valuable information that the carnatic, the vessel from hong kong to yokohama, is leaving that night instead of tomorrow morning.  however, to aouda's sorrow, the party finds another privately owned boat to take them to shanghai, leaving passepartout behind.  the party decides to go to shanghai because that's where the steamer to san francisco starts, then stops at yokohama and nagaski, then departing for san francisco.    much to the party's delight, they find out that passepartout actually did make it aboard the carnatic before it left, and they had a reunion aboard the san francisco steamer.  the steamer makes it into the san francisco bay on the third of december, and mr. fogg has neither gained nor lost a day.  the party then takes a rail passage from san francisco to ogden, only impeded by a herd of bison for three hours.  on the way from ogden to omaha, however, a band of sioux indians attacks the train.  three passengers are captured, including passepartout!      mr. fogg does his duty, and rescues passepartout.  fix, now having his best interests to get mr. fogg back to english soil as soon as possible, tells of a sledge that can be taken to the city of omaha, where trains are plentiful.    they take the trains to new york without stoppage.  however, upon arriving at new york, they find out that the china, the steamer going to liverpool, left only forty-five minutes beforehand!  mr. fogg's party is able to board a private boat, for two thousand pounds each.  he then `persuades' the crew to set sail for liverpool.  a storm makes the crew resort to steam power only.  they run out of coal and have to burn the wooden parts of the ship, which mr. fogg buys off the owner for sixty thousand dollars.    they take a rail line from queenstown to liverpool, gaining twelve hours on the steamers.  the arrive in liverpool at noon on the twenty-first, leaving only eight hours and forty-five minutes to get to the reform club.  but, much to mr. fogg's surprise, he is arrested by fix.  but the thief had been caught three days before!    after a three-hour delay, they charter a train to london, where they arrive at 8:50-five minutes too late.  the next day, mr. fogg and aouda decide to get married.  when passepartout runs off to find a reverend, he learns that it's only the 21st instead of the 22nd!  mr. fogg arrives at the reform club at the preset time, winning his wager!  by traveling east, he had gained a day during his journey, allowing him to win his wager.    jules verne does a great job balancing facts and excitement in this novel.  he provides an exciting science-fiction story, while giving some great info on places around the world.  i enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone with a sense of adventure, or whoever has dreamed about going around the world. around the world in eighty days	1
"this book was a waste of time to read.  it comes down to this,  eat sensibly and in moderation, exercise and the weight should come off.  if you only have 10 pounds to loose, i wouldn't recommend it.  it seems like this book is geared torwards people who have a lot of weight to loose.  if i followed this diet, i would be famished.  eat when you hungry, why wait for the ""miracle"" three hour?  i just don't get it.  i think the book was also more about joining jorge's website. its really about common sense"	2
"this book is analagous to buying a new elliptical, anxiously opening the user manual to find out how this new piece of equipment is going to benefit you,  only to find page after page outlining the technical details of the inner workings of the machine with the last sentence or so briefly mentioning the effects the machine can have on your life. the author is obviously an expert on the subject of astronomy and how it relates to ancient historical monuments, but he is so caught up in the technical details that ""the transformation of our consciousness"" is brushed aside as an afterthought. instead, the author drones on and on and on about monuments, angles, precessions, measurements etc. it's obviously necessary to briefly cover the technical aspects to build a foundation for the more exciting stuff to come, but this book never builds on that foundation. there were brief moments when i thought the book started to get really interesting, but the author would quickly revert back to the same old empirical, newtonian shallowness with more chapters that should have been titled, ""who gives a [...]."" john major jenkins is not really interested in the metaphysical side of this subject, and if you don't believe me, i quote page 239 of this book...""as a reminder, my work is not really to identify a mechanism that could empirically explain why a solstice-galaxy alignment might have transformative effects for life on earth."" my question is then why mention the transformation of consciousness in the title when it's hardly mentioned in the book? you would think that the benfits and effects of the sun aligning with the galactic center is going to have on our consciousness would be the main focus, since after all, it's what most of us should be most concerned with. if you are preparing for a test in astronomy, this book is for you. 2 stars for the misleading title. very misleading title. reads like a boring technical manual"	2

there's a lot to like in this book, theoretically. the worlds themselves are well-drawn, the language curt and no-nonsense with occasional flights into a kind of hard cyberpunk beauty (that sort of mimics but doesn't really ever come close to the best that william gibson has given us). the science is seamlessly integrated into the story, and you come away with the impression that a lot of thought went into its structure.    the theory doesn't hold, though. this just isn't a very good book.     the action follows three different characters, along three different threads. at first, and for most of the book, they have no obvious connection with each other. their stories appear to unravel aimlessly, and although lots of stuff happens, none of it seems to be in the service of an actual story. it has the effect of three brutal picaresques without destinations, physical or moral.    there is a payoff, but it takes a long time to get there, and by the time i did i was so exhausted and dispirited by the intervening unpleasantness that it didn't really have much of an impact.    there are three major problems with this book:    information withholding: i like books with central mysteries, that make you wait (and work) to understand what's going on. it's a good propulsive technique, plot-wise. but the mysteries need to resolve. the author keeps us confused pretty much the whole way through, dropping occasional hints that aren't so much tantalizing as frustrating. as i said: by the time i figured out what was going on, i'd stopped caring. this might just be my limitations as a reader, but i gather, from other reviews, that a lot of people feel the same way. you work so hard to understand what's going on that it's difficult to enjoy any of it.    dreams: harrison uses dreams both in the service of both theme and plot: to elucidate the characters' psychology, and to give us a window into their past. this is unfortunate, because (in my mind) dreams are lazy plot devices that give the author an excuse to stop the narrative and jump back for some convenient exposition, instead of wending it into the story. generally speaking, as soon as i hit a dream sequence, i lose interest. i lost interest a lot in this book. which is a shame, because the content of the dreams here is often wonderful, strange and sometimes even touching. it just needs to be presented better.    unremitting dourness: there is nothing pleasant about reading this book. the main characters are either savage and unlikeable, pitiable and unlikeable, or mystifying and unlikeable. often all three. and, with the exception of the wife (who i liked almost as much as i pitied), none of the supporting characters are much use either. the worlds they inhabit are brutal, dire, unpleasant, and dour. there's a lot of sex here, but as portrayed it's mostly just another kind of violence. the whole thing's kind of a downer, pretty much the whole way through, and the strange note of hope at the end comes off false and unconvincing, as if it's been grafted on from another, happier book.    the writing itself has some odd lapses too, given the care that went into the structure of the book, and the obvious attention to detail. lots of tortured, passive sentences. a few bits of dialogue that sound like campy chandler.     harrison is obviously very talented. i wanted very much to like this book, and i suspect i'll pick up another one of his novels sometime in the future. there's a great deal of potential here. it's just that most of it went unrealized. only theoretically good	2

"it took me less than a day and a half to read this book. and thats not because i was ""glued to it"" or ""thought it was a real page-turner"" but basically because it was a real fast read. however, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of stephen king's boredom with writing horror/fiction. his work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a ""cookie-cutter"" method. now, don't get me wrong, king is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. stories that seem to transcend the ""horror genre"", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama.  however, this is not one. i would rate this book only behind ""insomnia"" as the most insipid king novels i've ever read. i don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of king's work. but for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking ""oh....it's going to be another one of these stories huh?""  these meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable ""generic"" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very ""generic"" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. and this is one of those books where king's references to east coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product.  some examples of king's finest work would be ""the talisman"", ""night shift""(the best collection of short horror stories ever), the shining, the ""dark tower"" sieries, and the stand, just to name a few.  and if you have not read any of ""the bachman books"" (king as bachman) ""rage"", ""the long walk"", road work"", and ""the running man"", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.    this, however, isn't. and unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time. a perfect example of king's boredom with writing"	0

started the book and put it down as i was not very interest in hearing the author's personal journey as i was interested in learning this style of self defense. the illustartions were too small and the exercise routine was left until chapter nine!!    i however feel that there will be some positives from reading the book. less krav maga	2
when i first obtained partners in crime by j.a. jance, i had no idea the story was taking place in bisbee, in cochise co., arizona, which only added delight to my reading enjoyment.  i lived in sierra vista which is also in cochise co. a few years ago, and i must say the descriptions were pretty much to the location. for me it was a step back in time. which made it a 5 star for me.    i came in contact with sodium azide when my vehicle ran into a brick wall, which was a choking situation. maybe it will serve a purpose if everyone would contact their state representatives about how the substance is being left in discarded vehicles.    it was refreshing to find a female sheriff in bisbee, az, it being a macho town like so many of the border towns.  however sheriff joanna brady does very well being a newcomer investigating a murdered rochelle, who was in the witness protection program; a second murder, and having to share the investigation with beaumont.   i enjoyed the mystery; it was a quick read with wonderful memories for me. enjoyed the book	1
postrel forces you to think explicitly about the future.  i have 10 children.  thus i have more invested in the future than most people.  the future my children and grandchildren inherit and create be mostly shaped by people with dynamist views.  after all, it is the dynamists who created civilization.  to be sure, history is full of examples where the forces of stasis won over the dynamists, sometimes for centuries.  however, i think the future is with the dynamists.   i'm betting this book will be considered a seminal classic 100 years from now. why care about the future?	1
let me see if i have got this right? the only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way? that way we all gain? ok the bosses of nike, mcdonalds, and wal-mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk, but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide?    sounds good: who would want to be the party pooper?!    well someone's got to be, and for the simple reason that we don't live on a planet the size of jupiter.     the oil's finite: we know that but can't be bothered to act on it. even the supply of water is turning out to be finite: the south east of england is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water. ok, they could ship it in from the rest of the uk where there's no problem, but for reasons that don't quite add up that's not possible. it's not the corporate solution, if you will forgive the pun.    has it occurred to anyone, i wonder, if it's capitalist-driven growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems? yes, i know marx and stalin don't offer any fixes, but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced: growth is going to wind-down whether we like it or not. the elephant in the capitalist room	0
"i have loved each and every one of jane hamilton's other novels and highly recommend them:  the book of ruth, a map of the world, short history of a prince and disobedience.  this book, sadly, does not rank among them.  it feels forced and uninteresting, with outlandish and unrecognizable characters and scenarios.  i've already paid for it, so i'll probably try to finish it, but don't waste your time or money.  read another hamilton instead. agree with ""lost in translation"""	0

mr. gray spins quite a story of how he accomplished quite a bit at such a young age. his drive to better his situation, but more importantly help others, is very inspirational. the instances where unscrupulous people took advantage of his inexperience is a critical inclusion in this type of story. this is a good read for teens and people needing an example of how you can achieve if you believe in yourself and never stop working towards your goal. how to not be a victim of circumstance	2

the cover photo of an alert non-gerber baby.  an old family photo topping each chapter.  these help set a whimsical tone skillfully followed through with words only a mother could love.  from tufted-head to stubbed-toe, this book celebrates the spunk of youth with countless recalls of which our inner tot can relate.    we could long for a dad like hers--who loved his third child enough to casually coin her zippy.  through her eyes, this family doesn't take itself too seriously.  how zippy organizes and rationalizes daily undertakings is felt as youthful, reads as youthful.  the flightiness of friendships, unnerving nature of neighbors and natural distancing from parents are all taken in stride and delicately expressed.  she's a child with shameless pride in plainness.  any precociousness is thankfully not odious.  this folk-child character seems too clever to be actual, too enlightened to be real, but we're more than happy to play along.    the book's subtle intrigue--all well told with a perception that belies its naï¿½ve charm.  haven kimmel has pulled off some retro-realism with finesse.  a delightful and amusing read. a girl named zippy	1
the only book i've ever read that i tore up and threw in the trash when i was finished. if this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.this is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. when a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. this book is sickening. don't buy it!!! there are no animals only pain and death. disgusting	0
i bought this book thinking it would be a more specicfic musculoskeletal companion to braddom's generalized pm&r textbook. unfortunately the treatment paragraphs (most important section from my perspective) for each topic were very thin and nonspecific.  they were woefully inadequate for an attending or physiatry resident.  i sent the book back which unfortunately meant i didn't get to critique the dvd. need more detail	2

"there is no doubt in my mind that josh harris is a good person, who sincerely wants to help people, particularly young christian women, who are especially affected by the vicissitudes of the modern dating scene. however, he doesn't seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular.  either he's guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant: inexcusable in either case, considering how influential this book has become.     is it because it offers the best possible advice on how to navigate the most clear and direct path from singleness to marriage?  no.  for the vast majority of singles, the approach described in this book will be too rigid and contrived to be workable.  few couples have actually gotten together this way.    the real reason why this book, with its overwhelmingly female readership, has sold so well comes down to one main reason: there is a severe shortage of single christian men, as documented in campuslifecollegeguide.com male/female ratios, and the barna research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the millions.  christianity today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that ""rises to the top"" for christian singles.    because christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from ""god's plan"" for their lives, many of the surplus women faithfully avoid doing the math, but certainly feel the lack of male attention.  unfortunately, this often gets boiled down to some kind of ""passive christian guy thing"", but it probably has more to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women: which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage, whether it's new york city, post-war russia or your local mega-church.  it's not so much a lack of male leadership, but a lack of males.    and so the idea of courtship appeals to the romantic longings of single christian women frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of initiative taken by single christian men, who they greatly outnumber.  since reading christian books about relationships can be as titilating as any romance novel, many of these women will pour over every detail looking for the one piece of advice, the one thing they can change about themselves that will make a difference.  which means they stay on the spiritual self-improvement treadmill, fuelling a christian singleness industry with its own slogan ""the gift of singleness"" that refuses to tell them the truth about the christian man shortage that is the greatest cause of their prolonged singleness!  of course, their lack of contentment (an innate response that tells you that things don't add up) is something they are told to repent, ironically by pundits who themselves will not repent of how they profit from this symbiotic relationship.  but as long as these women can be convinced that their discontent is caused not by unnaturally protracted singleness that's the result of the christian man shortage but their by own spiritual failings, there'll always be a market for christian self-help books like this one.  pure genius!    what's more, there are ""unintended consequences"" that can go along with harris' model for ""courtship"" that he doesn't really address:    1) because all masculine initiative taking must be based on a guy's intention to marry the woman, it makes asking a woman to do anything a big deal to him. this can have several sub-consequences:   (a) it creates a lot of anxiety for guys in terms of their decision-making and rejection-risk (getting turned down for a date is bad enough, but imagine having your ""potential marriage proposal"" crash and burn!) (b) it fosters prolonged crushes, as stakes get so high with the guy investing all kinds of time and energy in figuring out that this is ""the one"", he might not ever do it (c) ironically, it can boost up the guy's expectations in terms of a woman's looks. because the guy has to have everything worked out in their heads (that yes, this is the kind of woman i want to marry) lot of guys end up not bothering to spend time with girls who don't look like whatever their ""wife prototype"" might be. guys who date and don't make a big deal of ""a date"" are more likely to ask out women they never thought of marrying and possibly end up getting married anyways (in ""how to get a date worth keeping"", henry cloud explains how couples will admit that their spouses weren't really ""their type"" when they first met).   2) it keeps people from the humbling reality check that dating provides. serial dating (as practiced in latin american countries, where a guy will ask out tons of women, get turned down by most of them until he has a ""short-list"") teaches you where you stand with the opposite sex. you ask your way down your ""ladder of options"" until you find your equal (likewise for women, in terms of dealing with the facts about who's asking and who's not). with courtship, a man or woman can nurse an untested prototype of what they want in their heads for years. the idea that it's better not to have any previous flames to compare them to is false. you're better off being compared to their last girlfriend/boyfriend (a real human being with chunky thighs and all) than with the evangelical angelica jolie/brad pitt that has filled their imaginations since adolescence!   3) it reduces interactive opportunities that promote the acquisition of social skills needed in a romantic context with the opposite sex. it reinforces the pattern of psycho-social-sexual immaturity you commonly see in christian singles circles.   4) it's unfair to the woman to have some guy spring a potential marriage proposal (which is essentially what courtship is) on her without any prior notice that the guy (who's had a head start on working out his feelings) is romantically interested. most christian women seem to need some time to progressively get used to the idea of having a date with most of the guys who would realistically ask them, let alone entertain the thought of marriage.   5) it also heightens the significance of anything the men do when interacting with the women in their circle, who inevitably end up reading too much into their behavior and expecting too much whenever any nuance of interest gets expressed by a someone they like. kind of like, ""he's a nice, sincere, christian guy and he wouldn't be spending this kind of time with me if he didn't think of me as marriage material, right?""...not always so.     if we are to stand back and take a look at it, the whole courtship redux really hasn't gotten off the ground: it works for too few people at this time. maybe the world has changed too much, or perhaps there are other issues today's christian singles face in the mating game that need to be dealt with first: such as the confusion about ""the gift of singleness"" and the shortage of men. i would recommend debbie maken's getting serious about getting married: rethinking the gift of singleness for an alternative view of courtship that embraces the ordinariness and universality of marriage, instead of this moldy oldy. profiting from the christian man shortage"	2
"i can't speak with authority about other deseg cases, but i am knowledgeable about the st. louis case, having spent four years on the st. louis board of education (1989 - 1993.).    simply put, deseg has destroyed the st. louis public schools (slpss), which were arguably, the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg, when they were segregated and run by white lutherans.    today, after 26 years of deseg, the slpss are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of missouri. let's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as kozol:      costs    deseg has cost the state of missouri about $8 billion between the kansas city and st. louis cases. the bill in k.c. totaled about $3.5 billion when it finally ended, while the st. louis case has almost certainly passed the $4 billion mark. (these statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media.) what have we realized from this expenditure?    first of all, state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in missouri not participating in a deseg case. small, rural school districts routinely spend between $4,000 and $5,500 per pupil each year. in st. louis, the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $11,711: yet, those rural, so-called ""out-state"" districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students, despite having half the resources. (i'm sure in kozol's mind they are merely ""goyim,"" and deserve no better...)    ironically, while less affluent ""out-state"" districts were robbed of state funding by deseg, the wealthier school districts in st. louis county experienced a massive windfall from deseg: since they are reimbursed by the state the average per-pupil cost for each city transfer, (rather than their ""marginal"" cost,) wealthy districts such as clayton, ladue and parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues, although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other missouri district by a factor of three or more. (for example, clayton currently spends about $15,000 per pupil per year.)     achievement    in the slpss, half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests. this stat would be even worse, except that (i am told) the ""ld"" (or ""learning disabled"") kids do not take the standardized tests. there are legions of ld kids...    in a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety, a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s. that study, called the ""lissitz study"" revealed that city students (i.e., black students) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the slps. that is, they improved less than students in all-black, the ""naturally""-integrated, and ""magnet"" schools.    when the educational testing service still ""normed"" the sats between 400 and 1600, the average slps student had a combined sat of 760. worse yet, these were the best and most motivated students, with further educational aspirations, who ""self-selected"" themselves to take the sats and were therefore, a highly ""skewed"" sample relative to the average slps student.      deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that, if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools, black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids. now that even william coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject, (""the coleman report,"" cited in ""brown v. board,"") kozol and deseg's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of ""the bell curve"" in order to understand academic disparities between the races.    vested interests    it has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system. this is because the naacp legal defense fund is a ""co-plaintiff"" in most (if not all) u.s. deseg cases, and is periodically distributed ""legal expenses"" by the federal courts. these are a very important source of revenue to the naacp, which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades.    similarly, deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around. one of the most injurious elements of the st. louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers. the slpss now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the n.b.a., and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections.     essentially, the same black women who, 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as ""domestic"" help, are now slps teachers and administrators. (""i is a teacher."") how anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but kozol and deseg's other defenders. if teachers and administrators in the slpss were required to take the s.a.t.s, more than half would test significantly below average: we know this because they have already demonstrated the fact!    approximately half of all slps teachers and about 60% of its administrators attended harris-stowe state teacher's college, which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of ""higher learning"" in missouri. last time i called their admissions office, i was told that harris-stowe accepted applicants with a combined sat of 780. it should come as no surprise that recent measures of slps student sats do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers.      hypocrisy    a truly fascinating phenomenon i have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program. it doesn't take a parent long to understand that deseg isn't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day, or your daughter gets beaten up because she won't date outside her race.     now kozol may not have kids, but i'll just bet that if he does, they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs, if any were available where he resides. (the jews are mustard for this sort of thing, as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it doesn't actually cost them anything...)    i once had the rare opportunity to sit next to dr. susan uchitelle, the  jewish woman who headed the st. louis deseg's ""voluntary inter-district coordinating council"" throughout the 1980s and 1990s. (she was paid $60,000 per year, but from what i could discern, her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media, so the rubes out there wouldn't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing, gun-shot incident, murder, or race riot.)    i considered it an ""opportunity"" because i was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before: ""have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program?"" (that is, were her kids, who would have been ""poster children"" for the county-to-city deseg program, allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools?)     what do you think was the answer, oh gentle reader? your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants, such as jonathan kozol...     (i'll give you a hint: susan uchitelle's attitude toward deseg is very much like leona helmsley's attitude toward taxes...). 2005's most dishonest book"	0
professor shaw is certainly not starved for thoroughness in presenting the rise and fall of the ottoman state. but what this text boils down to is something that herman melville would have penned had he been a scholar in turkish history. piling on fact after fact after fact is not conducive to a worthwhile learning experience. you would need more than two hands to count how many times i flung this text against the wall, and i consider myself to be *very* patient. luckily, there are alternatives available. halil inalcik does a much more lucid job--his book is the one to get. ugh, painful	2
"i have been a fan of j.a. jance since i met her in a bookstore browsing through the mystery section. she convinced me to try one of her books, which i did, and loved it. she had also told me that she would soon start a new series - that was many years ago and i've been enthralled with each new book since the joanna brady series began. these books usually leave you turning pages as fast as you can read, but this one wasn't quite that captivating. don't get me wrong, it was still very good, just not the excellence i've come to expect from jance's writing.     this is the ninth novel featuring joanna brady, a tough arizona sheriff who enchants her way into the reader's hearts. in the last novel, devil's claw we leave joanna as she's honeymooning with her new husband butch, after having her home destroyed by a maniac. paradise lost picks up shortly thereafter.     joanna is once again caught in the struggle to maintain balance between being sheriff, being a new wife, and being a mother to a 12-year-old. while joanna and butch are at a sheriff's conference across the state, joanna's daughter, jenny, goes on a girl scout campout. jenny and another girl, dora matthews, sneak off after lights out only to find trouble in a big way. they stumble across a dead body. because the girls were breaking rules, they are sent back to bisbee while the sheriff's department investigates this murder in apache pass.     when dora matthews, turns up dead the next day, joanna is worried about jenny's safety and the balance between the various hats she wears comes tumbling down around her. added to this second murder, is a third murder - the body of the prime suspect in the first murder turns up. three deaths in a matter of four days are more than bisbee has ever seen and it's up to joanna to help solve them.     the end of paradise lost is predictable and not one of the better suspenseful conclusions that jance has created in the past. j.a. jance has always tied up the loose ends, but this time she leaves one flapping in the gentle arizona breeze. the subplot involving a series of carjackings is never fully developed and leaves much to be desired by the reader. she eludes to this subplot several times, but there is no meat to it and nothing ever comes of it - no tie in to the murders, no interesting side journey, just a passing mention every once in a while.     and a low point in this book was joanna's wavering attitude towards her overbearing mother, eleanor. she finds neutral ground and ""understands"" her mother. i didn't buy it - it was too passe for me. joanna wouldn't buy into the poor, poor me bit, the martyrdom, that her mother is excellent at portraying. but this time she does and it is very anti-climatic - i wanted a good, old fashioned tongue lashing that we've come to expect when these two clash.     the one thing that is decided in this book is joanna brady will run for reelection as cochise county sheriff. i'm sure the next book in this series will encompass the campaigning and how it affects butch and jenny. it should be interesting. a bad time for motherhood"	2

"i picked this book up because i was running out of decent mystery novels, and figured i was primed to love it given my obsession with the outdoors as well as mysteries.     it only gets two stars because i actually made it through.  and i only got through it because i had nothing else to read.       i know nevada barr is a ""name,"" and judging by the number of her books stocked in my local bookstore, a popular one. but i could list the things that are wrong with her writing for...well, let's just say more space than amazon is going to give me for this review. her prose is bad. her imagery is unlively (and if you're going to write about a landscape like anna pigeon's, you sure as hell ought to be able to write it). her characters range from the merely flat to the utterly ridiculous (anna's romantic progression through this book: ""oh, i am widowed and my life will never be the same without my husband"" to ""oh, it might be fun to be a lesbian"" [an out-of-the-blue idea the author never bothers to resolve] to ""let me have a fling with this random man, who, by the way, has as much character as a cardboard cut-out"").     worst of all, she cheats. i guess mystery writers don't have an official code, but according to the dorothy l sayers model, thou shalt not give the detective clues not given to the reader. a mystery novel is no fun if the puzzle isn't there for you too. of course, if nevada barr had given us all the evidence she gives anna pigeon, there wouldn't be a mystery to have a novel about. her cheating merely covers up her inability to produce an engaging and puzzling plot.     this was a pathetically sub-par book for the amount of attention it and its sequels have received. if you're looking for an amazing female detective, check out laurie r king's two series, one about sherlock holmes' feminist partner mary russell (as unlikely as it sounds, and more than good enough to make up for it), and the other about san francisco cop kate martinelli. if you want a book about living in the desert, i'd suggest edward abbey's _desert solitaire_ (it even has a brief appearance by a dead body), or his hilarious eco-terrorist adventure _the monkey wrench gang_.     anything but this. yecch..."	2

the original text was written by captain charles johnson in 1724.  in 1932, john robert moore announced that the real author was daniel defoe.  he was so certain that he wrote a book about it (defoe in the pillory and other studies).  he was so convincing that most libraries/ publishers changed the cataloging.  however, in 1988, p. n. furbank and w. r. owens proved him wrong, also in book form (the canonisation of daniel defoe), based on the fact that there wasn't a single piece of documentary evidence that defoe wrote the book.  long story short, johnson wrote the book, not defoe. to clear some things up on the issue of the author...	2
"this book is about a skeptical journalist who finds himself on a most revelatory venture when he accompanies ian stevenson, noted reincarnation researcher, on trips to investigate cases.    he openly acknowledges his skepticism at the outset, and slowly reveals how he became convinced that there is something going on in the area of reincarnation studies.  ian stevenson is very cautious and methodical, rejecting any cases that have even a hint of taint of the subjects.  under his exacting criteria, he still finds some cases that simply cannot be explained away as products of hoax, inadvertent communication of information, or the great catchall, ""coincidence"" or ""lucky guesses.""    i appreciated how mr. shroder revealed his skepticism and came to an understanding that there is a lot more going on in the universe than what can be explained through traditional approaches to reality. illuminating"	2
i can actually understand morvan's character better given the 14th century backdrop of this novel. however, anna sounded more like a 21st century feminist to me. she did not sound very genuine for a woman in that period. i wish madeline had never written this book, given that this is the only one of her 11 novels (if i remember the number correctly) that i had to put down before reaching the end. i just could not take the characters, mainly anna. however, i loved to see david drop by :)..     rags. i disliked anna	2
"i remember hearing about this book by the great patriot sean hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. from that time on, until august 20th 2002, i waited for what i thought would be the greatest book of all time. i remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: ""let freedom ring"" with not just a picture of sean hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. i loved it, couldn't be more happy.    well, the day of the book's release, i took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. it looked better than i ever imagined.    with the flag on the cover and the title of ""let freedom ring,"" i thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. i expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. maybe some firework sound effects.     boy was i wrong. i opened the book only to the colors black and white. no red. no blue. no stars and stripes. i quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. i found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.     at that point, i went into a 4 year long depression. i nearly committed suicide at several points. it's only now that i can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.     i say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. there are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.     i have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. i went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much i love america and the stars and stripes, suggested i have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.     the methodoloy was simple: a book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.     we found some very good books and they did cheer me up. the one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called ""president jesus: how jesus wrote the constitution, freed the slaves, and won world war ii."" its published by a small church in texas. i was very proud of my students for finding it. it has brought countless joy to my life. along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. i'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. i've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. people even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.     now i often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. where are the flags? and sound effects?"	0
i loved the secret life of bees but i found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting.  its difficult to like any of the characters, especially  the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. it has as much deapth as a harlequin romance novel.  the relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly.  all in all, a poor follow-up to sue monk kidd's break out bestseller.  don't waste your time. can't believe it won the quill award	0
"these heartbreaking words are spoken by quasimodo near the very end of this novel but they could just as easily have been uttered by any number of the characters in this magnificent and awe-inspiring story. because of an inappropriate english translation of the title of this book, not to mention the popular characterization of quasimodo, it is always assumed that the ""half-made"" and hideous-looking bell-ringer of the cathedral of notre dame is the central character of this tragedy, but he is not. his unrequited love for the beautiful la esmeralda is only one of the tragic tales told throughout this novel.     the story is set in medieval paris in the year 1482. the town has just celebrated the feast of fools with quasimodo being chosen as the reigning pope for the celebration. quasimodo is the adopted son of claude frollo, the archdeacon of notre dame cathedral. la esmeralda is an exquisitely beautiful young gypsy girl who, along with her trained goat, djali, performs throughout the streets of paris to the delight and amusement of the townspeople. dom frollo has been secretly lusting after la esmeralda and believes her to be a witch sent by satan to turn him away from his priestly vows. on the evening of the feast of fools, dom claude enlists quasimodo to help him kidnap the gypsy woman in order to do away with her and rid his life of the temptations she represents. esmeralda is rescued but the night will set into motion a tragic chain of events which will ultimately claim as its victims all three of these central characters. two other victims in this tragedy are dom frollo's younger brother, jehan, who the archdeacon cared for from the time he was orphaned as infant but who turned out to be a great disappointment and esmeralda's mother, perhaps the most tragic figure in the entire novel, a woman who believed for fifteen years that her daughter was dead only to be reunited with her and have her taken away again all in the space of a few minutes.     this novel is filled with unbelievably vivid descriptions of the city of paris and it's medieval inhabitants. victor hugo brings the city to life and you will feel as if you are actually walking the streets and experiencing events as they unfold. when quasimodo is tortured upon the wheel in the pillory as punishment for his participation in the attempted kidnaping of esmeralda, you will feel yourself almost a part of the jeering crowd. the scene where esmeralda literally parts the crowd to come forward and offer quasimodo a drink of water has to be one of the most profound in all of literature! and near the end of the novel when quasimodo is frantically trying to fend off the soldiers and gypsies who are attempting to ram through the door of the cathedral and capture esmeralda, the scenes in which he throws not only boulders but bodies over the balustrade of the church are horrifyingly realistic.     it is hard to capture with words all of the feelings that victor hugo evokes with his splendid writing but suffice it to say you will be deeply moved by this story. i have been a fan of the film version with charles laughton and maureen o'hara for many years but as is most always the case, the movie cannot hold a candle to the book itself. this novel really defies the ratings here at amazon but as i can only give it at most five stars, i do so wholeheartedly and with great enthusiasm. the hunchback of notre dame is definitely the finest classic i have ever read!  --b. eden.

"i think i've now bought 6 copies of this book, for my own library, to lend to people who are interested and might benefit, and to give as empathy gifts to friends and relatives entering hospice, or their grieving families after a loved one's death.    i have stage iv - advanced, terminal or incurable (take your pick) breast cancer.  i've been in treatment, continually adjusting as best as i can to new treatments, new worries and new symptoms, trying to preserve as good a quality of life as possible along the way.  meanwhile, final gifts has helped me accept and move towards the idea of quality of death being an important event for me and those i love.  once i give up treatment, or treatment fails me (whichever comes first), i've arranged for a local hospice organization to help my husband and i cope, at home.  having read final gifts, it was easier for me to go ahead with planning my graveside funeral according to my culture and preferences, to hire a local stone cutter to design my headstone together - he has since completed it, other than the date of death, so it will be ready to mark my gravesite a week after i'm buried, and even to write my own obituary (to the extent that i know the information).  all this is done, a relief - even a pleasure, to have had a say beforehand, and final gifts, which i and then my husband read over a year ago, provided the impetus, and the hope for a death with dignity and beauty. a stellar book about the possibility of a ""good death"""	1

i'm a very spiritual person and i was expecting this cd to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life.  unfortunately, for me at least, the cd is rather boring and not very inspirational.  i'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it.  fortunately i have a christian radio station that does a lot more for me. unfortunately boring	2
"after purposely avoiding the entire harry potter frenzied bandwagon, i finally gave in.  my curiosity was peaked following a news story i saw in regards to some folks burning harry potter books in protest. i had to find out what exactly the fuss was about.  knowing nothing about the books i randomly picked up the prisoner of azkaban, actually the third book in the series by j.k. rowling.  the minute i picked it up, i couldn't put it back down and read the entire book and continued on to its two predecessors.  i had joined the potter bandwagon.    the story starts the same as each with harry spending the summer at his dreadful aunt & uncle's house before returning to another year at magic boarding school - hogwarts - where he is learning to be a wizard.  in this, his third year at hogwarts, harry, now 13, is a teenager and all the complications that accompany that stage of life on top of discovering there is an escaped prisoner from the wizard prison azkaban rumored to be pursuing him.  of course, the story isn't as simple as that.  for the first time, we get a real look into harry's past and the greater, darker story unraveling of harry's connection to the evil lord voldemort that will run the remainder of the series.  even with the impeding moments of doom, life saving time travel and frightening shadowy dementor's lurking about, the story isn't entirely angst filled.  there are plenty of humorous moments originating from normal awkward coming of age relationships and experiences.  from harry's two best friends constant bickering to discovering girls and a map of secret passages that leads to plenty of trouble and humor along the way.  when harry is warned escaped azkaban prisoner is after him, harry prioritizes like most normal teenagers by focusing on what is really important - sports!  whatever lofty expectations the surrounding wizard community puts on him, harry doesn't view himself as that hero.  his story is much like cinderella's story or the little princess by frances hodgson burnett.  like sara, harry finds his fortune, who his parents were, and his new guardian, but his troubles are not solely with his wicked step family or a money hungry orphanage keeper.  throughout harry & sara stay true to the people who have stood by them thru hardship.  they remember the true friendship and mercy from the few that bestowed it.     as a result of harry being rather new to the wizard world, he is naï¿½ve to the fear inspired by lord voldemort or rather ""you-know-who"" as the magic community refers to him as.  this allows harry to speak with a boldness that challenges the adults in his world to face a fear they don't wish to acknowledge.  harry sees the truth of what is to come, what they refuse to see; lord voldemort's return.  in the secret garden, also by burnett, mary lennox comes to mind.  while she was not as humble or endearing initially as harry or sara, with her obstinate & stubborn curiosity she helps the adults in her world to face the fears literally crippling the one thing they were trying so hard to protect.  as harry unravels his parent's death, in the process he brings to light the truth of those comfortable deceptions the adults in his world have chosen to believe; but understanding and acceptance does not come quickly.      and as with all the harry potter series the magic jargon and side stories fabulously set the stage and draw you into its world.  harry's world isn't the idealistic fairy tale where everyone lives happily ever after.  becoming a wizard doesn't give harry a perfect life nor does it return his parents, which is the one thing his heart aches for.   it is what makes harry a relatable and loveable character throughout the series. there are seven books total in this series by rowling, not including a few fictional hogwart's text books written as supplements.  six of the books are currently published with rowling working on the final book due out in 2007.  you won't find me in line at the midnight release for the highly anticipated finale, but i will be preordering!  it is a great fairy tale with boundless imagination and humor for all ages. my favorite harry potter volume..."	1

i was exposed to this book in what i think is the most unfortunate way possible, it was read to my child in her public school kindergarten class. i was stunned and emotional when she came home and told me her teacher told her that a candy cane was a j for jesus, and that the red stripes were his blood, and if she loved jesus the white would wash it away. my child is five years old, and was disturbed by the whole thing.  this book has no part of the christmas story in it, and the tasteless metaphor of it is impossible for a young child to understand.  the illustration is graphic and also not age appropriate.  the only good that has come from this absurd destruction of an innocent holiday treat is that now i am even more communicative and vigilant about my child's education and exposure, even in the school i trust with my child's life and well-being. shocked and disgusted	0
"as with most tv series you get statements with out support. so i tracked down the richard shenkiman book to get some background to the statements about american myths. i was not disappointed. it is as if he was reading this book on the tv with more graphic representations for the different media.   the book is worth reading. however the format may not be to some peoples liking as it is short choppy statements and the chapters are divided into subjects as, discoverers and inventors, presidents, sex, and art.   there is a fair set of footnotes to lead you to further reading. you may need this as he sometimes stretches a point.   final analysis, you are better off reading this to give a better perspective on reality. read it to your kids and save them a lifetime of ""legends, lies & cherished myths of american history"". a good compliment to the ""myth america"" tv series."	2
"living on the ragged edge is a commentary on the old testament book of ecclesiastes. this was a life-changing book for me in 1986. my whole life had literally collapsed right in front of my eyes. and i also had a nervous breakdown all in the pursuit of success and graduate school. this book seems to advocate living the ""simple life"", knowing god, having a wife and kids, not overdoing work or success. i have received alot of abuse the past 20 years about why i don't go back to graduate school; and the wisdom of this book is part of the reason. i had written to radio havana cuba once and had said that this is a religious book that even fidel castro could appreciate! i hear that since then he invited to pope to come to cuba to visit.  we do live in an insane money-hungry society that has no values, no philosophy, no religion but the pursuit of the ""almight dollar""! this ia a major reaqon for why we see american society disintegrating right before out eyes!  it is not deliberate, but i think i see myself as living in the 60's because of circumstances beyone my control. people in authority try to make my life as miserble as they can so as to pressure me into going back to college-this is called persecution.   the amazing thing about our secular achievements is that when we die, we do not get any reward in heaven for them. both solomon in ecclesiastes and jesus christ in the new testament say that we get no reward in the next life for being a successful doctor, lawyer or businessman. jesus said to lay up treasure in heaven-good works like charity towards the poor.  also i noticed that it is god who gives man the ability to enjoy life. and contrary to religious tradition in puritalical america, i have found on my electronic bible the advice to ""eat, drink and be merry""{within moderation, of course.) the phrase occured five times in ecclesiatstes. god gives the common man and the man who pleases him the ability to enjoy life. the life of the success driven rich man is so full of stress that he may have a fancy meal, yet he cannot taste the food he is eating! you can only live in one house at a time. you can only drive one car at a time. you can only spend so much money in this life because when you die, you won't have it any longer. you can have a house full of adult toys and possessions; yet you are unable to enjoy any of them. i would focus on having a couple of things and being able to use them to the full.  solomon spoke from experience. he was the richest man in ancient israel as he was the king. he had all the education a man could want. he had sexual pleasure-a harem of 500 wives like the sultan of brunei. he had more horses that he could ride. he had more achievement than he knew what to do with. yet he couldn't find satisfaction. his advice was to fear god, obey his commandments and enjoy the simple pleasure of life. he found out that sometimes more is less.   in an exotic fashion, i had found out about insight for living while monitoring trans world radio broadcasting from the island monaco to england in 1986. they sent me a magazine promoting the book. i bought it and the study guilde and used them both. i have read living on the ragged edge three times since them. this is obviously a message that god wants me to get into my spirit. and this is actually good advice for all of materialistic, worldly america!  another afterthought is this. i don't think that joining the army is the place to go to find god. but i had managed to get away from my home, family, church and social influences in toledo. i read the bible independantly and did not often attend church. i had found ecclesiastes in the old testament; yet the message seemed to offend and irritate me at age 17. i think that you may have to go through a few things in life, have a few misfortunes and find a need to look to god for answers in the bible to really appreciate this book and ecclesiastes! ecclesiastes is a book of godly philosphy! philosophy=the study of wisdom!. living on the ragged edge-the simple life"	1
"""the tao can be told is not the eternal tao.""     so you see, mitchell goes about the impossible task of translating and telling us about something that can't be told. if you understand this, you understand why rather than a literal interpretation, he chooses instead (and succeeds, in my opinion) in capturing the essence. it's hard for me to imagine anyone not liking this book but to each his own. as for me, i rate it as excellent without any qualifications. literalism vs. essence"	1
i personally feel that the  the book is small, being rightly meant to be carried by residents in wards, but cramped with borrowed information which exceeds the capacity of the book. a lot of it feature in other standard texts and nothing is new.the algorithms too are borrowed. information on antibiotic usage and common tropical disorders in detail are lacking. unnecessary publicity is being given to the book and the osler medical handbook by cheng and zaas is far superior to this in all aspects. another important aspect is that students reading the book do not read standard texts and are clearly at a disadvantage while appearing in examinations.the book needs to be rewritten in another format to be successful.  professor k.n.viswanathan , avmc, pondicherry, indi. the book is being overrated	2
i watched this movie in religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. i read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (i'm pretty  sure i saw this before) i was annoyed at how much it changed the book. i think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. the way mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. also i don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. i had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. don't get this version if your a purist. dissapointed	2
if you don't already have this book, get it.  it will not be a duplicate of something you already have.  my wife and i saw critters we didn't know existed, and we're both passionate about critters.  the author has a great writing style, the photography is excellent, the book covers a broad diversity of fauna.  it's not a field guide, not a biology text, it's fun and it's top notch.  i envy a previous reviewer that has been out on field trips with this guy. great animal lovers book	1
"i picked this book up at my public library because i had put it on my reading list a while back when i saw that the president(!) of the united states george bush read it while he was on vacation too.    i went to my local cofee place and got a medium regular cofee flavored cofee but in a large cup (so theres room for plenty of milk which i like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large).  anyway i am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where i have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there.  so then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning.  and he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.    anyway then he leaves and i notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as i thought previously.  so i'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so i take it back to the library.    now here i have to point out that i had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that i returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight.  well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever i go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when i turn the book in.  i explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.    but you can guess how this ended up.  i am down another $8 dollars and change (i paid the .50 cents in pennies i got from the place i keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since i counted them out one by one but it was worth it).  and i never finished the book since it was ruined.    but! i liked the parts i read ""okay"" and if the president likes it i guess it gets four stars only i made it two stars because i only read half.  maybe i will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then i will come back and give this book it's missing two stars if it ends well.    lesson learned is life is not always fair but you ""keep on keepin on"" like they say. only read half of it"	2
when i see suzanne somers i just see chrissy from three's company and all that snorting and dumb blonde-ing!  i never paid any attention to any of the suzanne somers books because i figured this was just another celebrity attaching their persona to something.  my library happened to have this on the shelf and since i had some time to kill while waiting for my daughter to pick out her books i decided to flip through the recipe section since i knew it was a low carb type of diet and i do atkins.  i was very interested at what i saw so i checked it out.  i have been totally shocked at how easy and terrific her ideas are and in fact her philosophy is quite interesting too.  i am really impressed.  i have a totally different viewpoint now of suzanne somers.  i love this recipe book so much i had to buy it so i&quot;d have a copy. i was surprised that this is such a good book	1
nobody seems to realize the personal element in this book.her insinuations of violence as revenge are rhetorical and come from millenia of do i even need to say it?it's not like she is speaking on behalf of the movement but in behalf/against the years.    nobody's going to puncture your larynx with a stiletto,alright?i suggest those who think a woman expressing her rage in a violent manner for justifiable reasons to be so taboo read henry miller's black spring.perhaps more to your taste. misunderstanding	1
"total control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). it had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). the last third of the book imploded as i was pleading for lead character sydney to get ""done in"" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. baldacci let me down on this one. let down"	2
long-time fans of the series will enjoy many elements of this book:  sharon and hy finally marry; sharon's birth mother and adopted mother meet one another; sharon's agency expands with some new operatives; and rae finds herself back doing some detection.  in addition, there's a dark, detailed plot that builds from a very old, cold case.     one of the strengths of this story comes in ms. muller's deft handling of so many past characters and weaving them the on-going story line.  it adds a rich texture to the book that builds depth.  that texture is nicely developed also by ms. muller's strong ability to build a sense of place as almost another character in the story.     the cold case is quite complex and requires an extensive investigation using many resources.  but it's not a classic mystery in that you'll be able to put three clues together in the beginning and figure out who did what to whom.  instead, you'll be able to figure out the next plot development in the procedural about 5-15 pages ahead of time.      the book's main drawback comes in its unappealing characters.  most readers like either sympathetic characters or disgusting villains.  this book lacked both.  the characters were either completely flat, highly superficial or just plain selfish.  but there was nothing about them to attract our interest other than the role they played in the plot development.      authors often have to choose between developing their plots and their characters.  while we get lots of character development concerning the missing laurel greenwood, it's ultimately unrewarding.  the plot's needs won, but it's an unsatisfying victory.    the book's overall theme is about what it takes to make a good marriage.  i thought that element was done well.  i especially appreciated the nods to bill pronzini's nameless detective as part of that message.    but any long-time fan will enjoy the book.  new fans should go back to the beginning of the series and delay this book. unraveling a tangled skein of deception	2
i was hesitant to read this because of it being on the supernatural side, but my friend encouraged me to read a couple of chapters befor making up my mind, and i am so glad she did.  it is one of the best books i have read.  even  if you don't buy into the whole ghost thing, i think that most will still love this book.  before you know it, you are totally wrapped up in it-- i couldn't put it down!. i was hesitant...	1
bosch is back and finally diving into his mother's murder case while he's been place on involuntary leave. our favorite detective is put through the ringer and has to come face to face with some rather ulgy demons from his past.  one girlfriend hits the road and another is quickly picked up on the rebound.  for a workaholic, bosch gets around.  this time, however, our rebound chick has some baggage--then again-so did our last girlfriend.  her husband was a psycho-cop.  so maybe he just attracts women with serious baggage.  though this was another multi-layered and complex case, i was able to figure out the real killer pretty early.  but with connelly, the journey is just as intriguing as the destination. another good one	1
sometimes, when an author writes a trilogy, it's the second one that lacks the same pizazz  you fell in love with in the first or the fantastic ending of the third.  this was not the case.  in fact, she wrote about the spicy heroine here in the second book and that's brilliant. great continuation!!!	1
"i normally cringe when i read ""read by the author"" on the front of a book on cassette because so many of them have no idea how to read out loud. elizabeth berg is a clear exception. she not only presents us with clearly delineated characters, each of them vocally fits the emotional description written by ms. berg. listening to the story is a delight.    the story itself is a triumph. each character is endearing and embued with the berg warmth. paige is remarkably optimistic, diana is properly rebellious, and peacie is tolerantly loving. as i am listening, i am seeing them all in my mind and i'm happy that they have come into my life for a few delightful hours. another elizabeth berg triumph"	2
"this is not a typical read for me, but i enjoyed it.  i read the first 148 pages wondering if this was going to be a waste of time, but when i hit chapter 44, i read the rest of the book in one sitting.  loved max, frannie, kit & all the others.  looking forward to reading ""the lake house"". leave reality at the door"	2
"i have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an american teacher named hope and po-yu (paul), her chinese student. on one hand, it was often very interesting, as ms. liu gives a lot of historical detail about san francisco and china. on the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. i didn't find hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. the romance between hope and po-yu rang false for me. (""honey, i first fell in love with you when i realized it was required for the plot to progress!"") i still can't see what attracted them to each other. also, did anyone else notice that any slight against hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but ms. liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde swede, a drunk, surly irishwoman, and hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the britons in the book are ""right-o, jolly-good"" bigots, and all the christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. in addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. and to top it all off, the ending was forced. this novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. and one more quibble: one of hope and po-yu's daughters is named jennifer pearl. in 1908 the name jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: cornwall, uk. good enough to make you wish it were better."	2
reading dark harbor is like watching a mediocre tv show that you can't be bothered to turn off. i listened to dark harbor as an audio book, so i don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because i `read it' while i was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.     if you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - dark harbor is not for you. this novel is about as innovative as an episode of murder she wrote. to illustrate: stone barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (i think i actually saw that one on murder she wrote) woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.     it is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in dark harbor. this isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. you can just tell. this doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. in fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.     it is as if woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with stone). holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. on her second trip she has an obligatory romp with stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.     why was she kidnapped? i don't think anyone - including woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. my theory is that woods needed to work holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. it also allowed him to include holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. wood's motive seems obvious. the kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. but clearly this was something woods didn't think was worth worrying about.     the best i can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). it may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic. an easy read to kill the time, but not much more	2
from age 4 to age 7, my daughter has greatly enjoyed cooking from this book.  unlike when we cook together from other cookbooks or recipes, when we cook from this book, she can really take the lead, and i am her assistant.  at age 7, she is able to make some of the items entirely on her own.  using this book has encouraged her to take an active role in preparing foods for our family and dinner guests.  she takes pleasure and pride in her creations, because she worked hard and they taste good!  because of the thoughtful design of the book, the child doesn't have to be able to read to figure out what to do, with a little parental help.  the recipes included are healthful and tasty. the drawings and layout are appealing to children and adults.  i highly recommend this book to families with children from preschool through at least second grade to get your children into the fun of cooking.  enjoy!. child-directed cooking	1
this book was great, such a heartwarming story. i only gave it 4 stars because i had just read marley & me before and the writing was a little better, but the story is just as good, nonetheless. i'm so glad i know the story of gracie and three dog bakery now!. amazing gracie, an amazing book!	2
mr. galvan's writing about a piece of property, at first, seems strange; however, as you read you become absorbed.  he writes of much more than the land, he writes of the people who live that land.  it takes a special person to live in the wilds of  wyoming, and an extrodinary person to live in the isolated, rugged, raw, and unforgiving areas.  this is a book i have given as a gift to many individuals who know what it is truly like to live here in wyoming, want to live here, or seem to possess that independence and creativity needed to live here. the life of a meadow	2

"walt whitman's life's work is his ""leaves of grass"", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  regarded as america's poet, whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the ""manifest destiny"" ideology of the pre-war, through the reconstruction period of us history.      the poems are diverse and upbeat.  the language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  very few poetic devises are used.    one may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  but, in comparison to rhyhming verse by longfellow, frost, byron, browning, or shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.      although a classic, ""leaves of grass"" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  none of his poems are memorable.  not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.    i give two stars to the work, simply because i must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, ""dead poet's society""; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is. known as america's poet, whitman is not poetic"	2
this book was required reading at our office and at the time i wondered why, after all we had a great team! after taking the assessment test i realized we had lots of room to improve! the story was a quick and easy read but very effective. we implemented many of the ideas in the book and work much more effectively today than we did a year ago. thanks for a great book. amazing insight!	1
four years ago i was completely smitten with noll's jung cult and the many facinating threads to follow from the book's many descriptions of cults, personages and movements at the time of the fin de siecle.  i thought noll  truly brilliant.  this past year i followed one of those threads from noll  to sonu shamdasani's cult fiction.  reading the two led me to a lesson in  scholarly research and withholding judgement.  i could have founded a noll  cult after reading his writing.  i learned to question it more objectively  reading shamdasani.  the two do a great tango and i have found it of  essence to read them both.  i don't know and find it ridiculous to say they  hate each other--hey they sell each others' books and i am a different  thinker and jung adept after reading both authors.  noll is rich with  references and associations--sonu questions very thoroughly and almost  without flaw noll's argument.  shamdasani does grip noll's hamstring but  the joy of reading the jung cult for me isn't flagged--only changed in the  sense of i am glad i got past noll to read sonu. a lesson in with holding judgement	1
this book does not compare with 1) atlas shrugged, or 2) the fountainhead.  in my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written.  if you haven't read them, put we the living aside and read them now.    i could not finish we the living.  i got sick of the stupid relationship.  i guess i got about 1/4th the way through.  maybe my tastes are changing. doesn't compare	2

jinichi tokeshi provides a succinct albeit comprehensive guide to kendo and all that is entails. it begins with a short history of kendo in an effort to familiarize the reader with the origins of the &quot;sport&quot;. tokeshi then spends some time on the necessities such as equipment and the correct manner in which to wear the kendogi and bogu! he also pays strict attention to appropriate etiquette and behaviour. the book deals with the movements, strikes, general philosophy, rules, regulations and ends with short biographies on historically significant samurai/kendo masters! all in all the book amicably demonstrates the &quot;elements, rules, and philosophy&quot; of kendo and as a new student to the japanese art of fencing it has proved indispensable. succinct guide to the art of kendo.	1
speaking as someone who has been both fat and thin in my life i can honestly say this book did nothing for me. i do believe that all women are beautiful and we all should love our bodies. however, i don't think this book gets that message across! it sounds like the person who wrote this is no expert and is angry because she looks the way she does, failed to find a solution and is looking to tell the world how we should think and what we should find attractive. besides that, it's kind of a one-sided book and repetitive. also, i beg anyone claiming that being fat is healthy to look at the statistics again. close to 60% of people in america are overweight, possibly more. this includes children. we are far bigger than we were 100 years ago and ingest far larger portions of food. heart attacks are killing more and more people and it's victims are getting younger, sometimes even children and people under 30 years old. sure, some people can be fat and healthy but those cases are so rare they are certainly not the majority. i do agree that pushing images of too-skinny supermodels is a bad thing but i don't think pushing overweight models would be any better. if you are overweight and looking to feel better about yourself, you might like this book. if you are like me and actually did something about the things you disliked, this will sound like a really whiny, excuse filled, negitive book. yes, i work out to be healthy. yeah looking better is a nice feeling but certainly not as important as how i feel. no, i don't want to look like a supermodel. i loved my body fat and i love it now, that's why i lost the weight to begin with. i want to live as long as i can in this body and feel the best i can instead of feeling slow, tired and heavy like i used be. i feel much better, my chronic foot pain went away and i have lots more energy. i work out 5 days per week and make a good living teaching others to be healthier too. this book does nothing to help people in the long run, it's just someone's angry rant about their warped perspective! being obese isn't healthy and that's why people think it looks ugly, it's not because we are a brainwashed, shallow society! and no, being fat is not a fate worse than death, it is death and kills millions of people every year!. i would not buy this. 	0
"i have often joked that i would rather read umberto eco's shopping list than many of the so-called popular novels. in this book, eco goes to prove me wrong. eco has written a book that is a struggle to read, not because it is deep, complex, and rich but because it is an utter bore.    the story tells of the case of yambo, a rare-book dealer living in milan. yambo suffers a curious brain injury straight out of the man who mistook his wife for a hat. in his case, he can not recall anything that ever happened to him but he can remember every book he ever read. curious. but eco fails to do anything of much interest with this defect. for example, yambo runs a book studio and has a female assistant. yambo worries that perhaps he had an affair with her and wonders how she would react. he need not have worried, because like everyone else, she treats him with no mention of the past. yambo's wife is perfectly accepting of his condition and yambo is able to bluff his way through conversations with any friends or acquaintances he meets. the end result is that nothing much happens and the book drones on.    yambo decides to ride off into the country to visit his childhood home in hopes that something there may trigger his memories. yambo wonders around and gives us a detailed description of his bowel movements. ""a lovely snail-shell structure still steaming."" i was underwhelmed. yambo wanders through the house finding secret rooms and reading old books. but none of this seems to go anywhere. in fact, it seems more like an excuse for eco to discuss (although not in any detail), pre- and post-world war ii italian novels that eco fondly remembers.    the book does pick up a little towards the final part but by then i just wished the book would end. i cared nothing for the main character of the story and found the whole enterprise an absolute chore to pull myself through. eco has done much better. if you are a true fan then go ahead and read the book to see that eco is, indeed, fallible. otherwise choose one of his other books instead. only the worst of eco"	2

the book gemba-kaizen is somewhat disappointing if you have read the book 'kaizen' already. it gives not much new information. the only new idea in  the book is the attention given to the 'gemba', the place where the  processes are performed. imai is right to stress the importance of the  gemba for operational excellence and he gives some nice tools and examples  to illustrate the gemba's importance. however, only one nice idea is  somewhat poor to fill a whole book. the major message of the book can be  told just as well in an articel of no more then 4 pages. not much new information when you have read 'kaizen' already	2
this play caused a great controversial stir when it was first performed in 1965. this is supposed to be a classic example of an existentialist and absurdist play. it was pinter's first stage play and the one that made his reputation. although it was very daring and shocking in 1965, the play has aged and lost its freshness and original power, in my opinion. there are many other portrayals of dysfunctional families that have retained their freshness and power--such families have been a mainstay of drama from the time of the ancient greeks. shakespeare and even fairy tales have built themselves around exploring the dark and abusive aspects of the family dynamic. so pinter's on to nothing new or radical here. the script as such is blatantly misogynist. the one female role, ruth, has no lines that sound human--she comes across as a stilted android. ruth is so obviously not a real woman but a male projection of lust, fear, possession, hate, and paranoia. i recently saw this play performed in manchester, uk, and have to wonder why people still think this play, with all its misogynist posturing, is relevant to a contemporary audience. if it were just a black absurd comedy, it might have worked better for me, but pinter seems to be aiming at something deeper and more menacing yet can't seem to make up his mind if we're supposed to be feeling sympathy with his characters or taking them (and the underlying meaning of the play) seriously or not. this play shows its age	2
how amusing we find the seventeenth-century minds which persecuted galileo for saying that the earth revolves around the sun. but we have living in our midst a man who is so brave he has stated a truth even more obvious than galileo's. of course the races aren't equal. everyone knows it but we don't want to admit it.  even most scientists are so scared that they would rather pretend that natural selection leaves intelligence unaffected. the official story is that it doesn't matter whether your race evolved in a jungle or a desert, the average brain will be totally unchanged by evolution. everything else will change - height, colour, blood, hair, bones, teeth, eyes - but the brain must by some undiscovered law of nature stay the same.  read this book for proof of what you, in your heart of hearts, already know. you know he's right	1
"when i read stuff on the back of this novel like, ""preposterously brilliant"", ""a classic comic novel"", and ""amis was a genuine comic writer, perhaps the best"", i immediately snatched this book up and started rummaging through the sentences, paragraphs, and chapters with heightened interest. the book was interesting enough for me to buy it from borders bookstore 30 minutes after reading a bit. even though i didn't laugh, i believed i just had to read it from beginning to end. so i took this book home expecting something hilarious; the result: a genuine cure for insomnia. i don't care for all these praises of ""masterpiece"" or ""this book explores the complexities of human condition and human relations"". i want an interesting read; i'm not calling for an action-packed ian fleming, james bond novel, i'm asking for something engrossing. i didn't get what i asked for.    the visually descriptive details in this novel are thoroughly lacking. amis doesn't bother to write about the setting, the atmosphere, the people (except for bertrand, christine, and margaret to some degree); as a result i have no idea what welch, dixon, beesley, etc. look like. they all could be wearing bedsheets all the time for all i know.     all in all, this novel is not recommended: it lacks physical detail and humor.     p.s. if you search all the previous good recommendations you'll see the high reviews were simply given by ""a reader""; probably the same dude. an absolute yawnfest!"	0

"volume iv of ""in search of lost time"" begins in the afternoon of the day of princess of guermantes's party, the one that marcel had looked forward for so long as his definitive entrance into the world of high society. that afternoon, by spying on them, marcel discovers with his own eyes, for the first time, homosexuality, in the form of an encounter between the depraved baron de charlus and the tailor jupien, marcel's neighbor in the property of the guermantes. later that evening, marcel attends the party, attended also by a cast of characters like very few in literature: charlus himself, a swann close to his death, and others. the dreyfuss cause keeps winning adepts, among them the very prince and princess of guermantes, as the injustice of the sentence is revealed. in the party, marcel continues on his way to disappointment about noblesse: they are people just like everyone else, only with grand names and big egos, but not much more.     days later, with his mother, marcel returns to balbec, where, alone in his room he finally feels all the weight and sorrow of his grandmother's death, which had happened a year and a half before or so. it is a profound passage about the perception of death, everyday indifference to it, and the memories left to us by our beloved's passing away. in balbec, marcel reencounters with albertine, in that perverted play of seduction and deceit, of attraction and rejection, which foreshadows a sick relationship. disturbed by the graphic discovery of homosexuality, marcel broods a lot about it. two women who stay at the same hotel, and who openly show their lesbianism, awaken in marcel a deep suspicion about albertine's mysterious life, and so begins a torment of permanent jealousy, of anxiety and anguish which reminds the reader of the similar episode, in times gone by, of the beginning of the relationship between swann and odette. meanwhile, marcel has simultaneous relationships with a couple of maids of the hotel (literally simultaneous).     marcel rents a car to go around with albertine through the countryside and the coast, deepening his relationship with the capricious, naughty, annoying and elusive albertine. in her company, he begins to frequent the little band of the social-climbing verdurins (where swann had met odette years before), in the country estate they have rented from the marquises of cambremer. the central part of the book narrates that summer in balbec and its surroundings, above all the wide mosaic of characters surrounding the verdurins: insecure but arrogant doctor cottard and his simple wife; musician vinteuil; the rustic and silent sculptor ski; professor saniette, pathetic and constantly humiliated; and madame verdurin herself, presumptuous and increasingly successful in society. over this fresco is shown the repulsive couple of charlus and musician morel, son of a former servant of the prousts. morel is the worst kind of climber and representative of sexual and moral corruption. in contrast with what happens in the first three volumes, here it seems that it is the nobles who yearn to be accepted in bourgeois society, and not the other way around. it is the bourgeois who attract interesting people: intellectuals, scientists, artists. charlus makes a fool of himself big time, pretending everybody ignores his homosexuality, when in fact he is the target of cruel jokes and gossip. so continues the great saga of memory, sex, love, longing, and social observation of the xx century.    like in no one of the previous volumes, in this one the subject of homosexuality is analyzed in all its complexity. marcel and albertine's relationship forebodes hell. charlus begins to sink. the bourgeois approach triumph. like in all the previous volumes, what astounds the reader is proust's immense power of microscopic vision to analyze individuals and dissect societies. it includes a magical reflection on dreams, as well as precious depictions of landscapes, sexual assaults, personalities and emotions.

mr hibbert writes in a very dull, dry tone and i found it incredibly hard to be engaged in the story. he confuses the reader with time, people and his interpretation of what elizabeth was like as a woman and a queen.  i only read this because i had to (for school). if you don't have to read it, then don't! it will bore you to death. a very dull, dry piece	2
i've been an acne sufferer since i was 13 years old, and have been on every antibiotic, tried every topical medication in combination with those antibiotics, and have been on 3 courses of accutane in the last 8 years.  my acne has never been extremely severe...but it has been quite resistant to most treatments.  i was really excited when i  bought this book and read the reviews, it sounded like it might really be the cure i'd been searching for all these years. the plan was a lot of work, especially at night with the ice packs, but i was willing to try anything. i followed the plan exactly as stated for 6 full weeks with little to no improvement.  that was my experience. unfortunately the cure did not work for me	2
"i finally found a book to recommend to people of my era who ""induldged"" once upon a time and now have kids of their own. responsible drug use can be no more traumatic than wine at dinner or the daily dose of caffine. it isn't about the drug it is about the way it is used and under what circumstances. teach children the facts and show them responsible conduct and they are likely to respond accordingly.       however, sullum did not write this book to condone the use of drugs. he wrote a book that instead argues to the logical conclusion that humans have always used drugs and they are likely to keep right on doing so. this book takes the wind out of the argument that drug use is somehow morally wrong. in fact he is pretty convincing when he claims that drug use is normal and to adopt a ""zero tolerance"" position towards drugs is impossible to do without creating high crime and coruption as a side effect. it is morally wrong to attempt to regulate moral behavior in a free society.  it is acknowledged in the writing that ""some"" people have trouble with drugs but the majority of users do not. spending hugh amounts of public money to stop drug use in a free society does not make any sense but sullum makes it clear to the reader that making sense has never been the point in the war on drugs. this really rung a bell with me because it appeals to my common sense and personal experience.my use of drugs in my younger days did not stop me from being honorably discharged from the military, getting a college degree or becomming a professional technician. i find that i am one of the many middle aged people who smoked some pot and still became reponsible adults. i also stopped, including cigarettes, when it no longer suited me. just as sullum points out that the overwhelming majority of us do.  so... i would highly recommend this book to you if you are questioning the rationality behind the war on drugs. it is not going to convince you that you should be doing drugs and that is not the pont of the work. this study will give you many well argued points that demonstrate how the effort to stop drug use through draconian drug laws is not working and worse, doing more damage to society overall than the drugs themselves are causing. an example of this is tobacco. the author wrote a grate deal on this point. this is one of the most widely used and harmful of all the drugs in our society. through education and a publily funded add campain the used of tobacco has dropped dramatically over the past 30 years without draconian enforcement. just the opposite has happened with marijuanna where the laws are becomming more and more draconian every year, the cost of enforcement is mind boggling and the easiest place to score a bag of pot is right down at the local high school.        it is a strange, sad situation to tolerate. balance and common sense."	1
this book is an adapted version of the author's doctoral dissertation. through ethnomusicological study of a music conservatory, prof. kingsbury brought to western music scholars and lovers a widened concepts of music,  music talent, and music performance. music is much more than sound  structure. music is also &quot;constructed&quot; by its social context.  comparing the book with the dissertation, the sequence of the chapters is a  bit different. there are also some additions in the temple university press  book version. it is a thought provoking book  for ethnomusicologists,  musicologists, anthropologists, and particularly western music lovers. music making as making more than sound	1

"i am big fan of pax (armstrong's company)and i own her book, cds, and have attended her seminars. i really liked keys to the kingdom in the book version, however, friends and family that listened to the book on cd hated it. not sure why exactly, but my recommendation is save a few bucks and get the book instead. also, you should be warned that her work can initially seem anti-feminist. hang in there though, because her message is meant to actually empower women in relationships. i can't tell you how much she forever changed my view and relationships with men. did i also mention that apparently alanis morissette is also an armstrong fan? in a nutshell, get her book, and her other cds like ""in sync with the opposite sex"". also, her cd ""the amazing development of men"" is a very condensed version of the concepts taught in ""keys to the kingdom"", which usually you can get for free if you attend one of her teaser seminars. get the book instead"	2
this author claims to use logic and skepticism, all i can see from his book is a lack there of. this book along with lyne's other book is the only propaganda, not some some massive cia front. i was once a believer but no longer, ufology and all that tesla nonesense is just that, nonesense. if you want to learn about physics read anything by the genious of einstein, not by this quack. if you don't want to waste your time i suggest getting any book by philip klass instead of this book. absolutely hilarious	0
"how can one write a review of the story of san michele that comes close to doing justice to the book?  there are many humorous episodes, such as the giant and mamsell agata, touches of the macabre in the description of the cholera epidemic in naples, misadventures, like the journey to sweden accompanying a young man (then his corpse).  there are also angry moments, as when his dog tom is brutally kicked by the slimy vicomte maurice.  who could not be moved by the story of the boy john, who was rescued by munthe but never lived long enough to find a loving home.  it is a book that includes many memorable events in a life that was very full indeed.  many of the chapters in this book could be made into marvelous films, given the right adaptation.    the story of san michele is very well written, to say the least, and the many people, events and personal feelings of the author combine to make this a special adventure.  perhaps most special of all is axel munthe's relationship to animals that allowed him to get close, even to ""wild"" animals and have a special relationship with them.  he was a man who held nature and all life in special regard but was pragmatic in the face of illness and death.       i have had a copy since 1988 and i have given axel munthe's book as a gift and been thanked for the introduction.  i could not recommend this book highly enough. a book to cherish"	1
thomas paine's &quot;rights of man&quot; is truly a classic defense of self government and reprsentative republicanism. paine copmletely demolishes edmund burke's defense of aristocracy and monarchy as outmoded and absurd institiutions. paine shows the immorality of monarchy and the plunder that it commits on it's own people through high taxes,unjust property laws,and priveleges for the nobility. paine shows the virtues a representative system has over the monarchial form. he denounces  aristocracy and monarchy as &quot;frauds&quot; and based upon tyranny. the first review by will murphy critsizing paine as a sort of statist is way off the mark. paine did recommend many ideals of the welfare state. it must be remembered he was speaking to an age where a large wealthy aristocracy ruled alongside the monarch, living in luxury off the high taxes drained from the middle, lower and working classes. paine was one of the formost defenders of freethought in religion,speech, and ideas.to imply paine was a sort of 18th century fascist is utterly absurd and ahistorical. paine was not an enemy of property, just an enemy of aristocracy,who in his day did not obtain property by hard work. usually property rights in monarchial nations were written to favor the wealthy and powerful, and grant them priveleges at the expense of the populace. paine completely destroys the ideal that a chosen few were meant or ordained by god to rule. if you love freedom, you can't go wrong with the &quot;rights of man&quot;. defender of self government	1
"i have read and reviewed many children's books in my 28 years as an elementary school librarian, and have found none with more glaringly inaccurate and unclear writing:washington is the evergreen state, not the ""chinook state"", mt.st. helens did not have ""lava"" flows as the text says it did, the section about the state says that the chinook winds are a ""pair of winds"" and does not explain what they are, they are warm winds that sometimes flow from east to west bringing warm air west. as a native of washington, i began, and ended, reading in the section on our state. after reading the section i did not bother to check to see if the other states information was as inaccurate and poorly written, as i knew that i certainly would not want this book in any library nor in the hands of any children, dispite the vissual appeal. don't know much about 50 states "	0
"pros: someone recommended this book to me, and when he did, i asked him why in the world would he think i'd be interested in a book written by a cop, specifically because i've never made it a secret that i do not trust police and i'm extremely burnt out on the biggie/tupac's death considering i wasn't a fan of either of them.  he told me that it talked about some interesting parts of hip hop crime and that there was only one chapter on biggie and tupac.  indeed, he was right. this book delved into the jam master jay killing, along with the criminal issues of murder inc., young jeezy, jay-z, diddy, 50 cent, j. lo, lil' kim, foxxy brown, suge knight, snoop, game, dr. dre, etc., in addition to the murders of freaky tah, tupac, biggie, and more.  it was interesting to read about the details that i did not hear in these cases, such as cops handcuffing j. lo to the top of the cage.  that's a prime example of why i feel the way i feel about cops. was it really necessary to do that?  in that aspect, i can feel this book. there were many times when parker complained about how the nypd handled witnesses and innocent victims as though they were criminals, and he hit it right on the head by explaining that if the nypd continues to be as domineering and violent as they have been to get people to talk, the streets and crime will continue to be on different playing fields with no intentions of a fair game.    cons: 1) i'll admit that even as a professional copyeditor, i can look over errors. it's much safer to let at least two pairs of eyes read a manuscript than one. i'm hoping that's what happened with this book. no copyeditor will catch every single error, but about a quarter through this book, i was seeing so many errors to the point where i wondered was it copyedited at all?  commas out of place, words in the wrong order, past tense with present tense, and other glaring errors that should've been caught by even the most casual reader.    2) i was so tired of this man patting himself on the back.  it was to the point where i thought he was molesting himself trying to talk about how great he was.  he kept italicizing ""i"" and ""me"" as if we didn't understand that he deserved credit for something. then, he kept on bragging about how cops were coming to him for help because he knew about hip hop.  in mid-story, he'd start talking about how he knew something was wrong because he was so well-informed of the subject.  okay, we get it.  if the man had just told the story and his actions, we could've come to the same conclusion without reading about you and your hip-hop superman cape.      3) over and over again, he made idiotic statements that only cops can come to the conclusion of.  the word ""accidentally"" and ""amadou diallo"" should never be used in the same sentence. that was flat-out intended murder; nothing accidental about it. even though he kept saying that hip-hop was not the full reason for violence, he kept throwing out all these random examples about how they equate, without ever mentioning the fact that poverty can play a great big hand in that.  he uses examples like kanye west to say that some rappers don't go down the same violent path, but what a drastic comparison.  kanye west didn't live nearly the life that snoop doggy dogg did and there's no way anybody is going to tell me that the neighborhood and economic gain does not play a hand in the attitudes that many ""gangsters"" and drug dealers have in how they view life.  this is not to say that it is right for them to be suicidal all the time, but i can't see how he couldn't understand that.    4) throughout this whole book, he made it seem like he was one of the best cops and he seldomly talks about anything he does wrong. even when he does, he blames it on his boss making him do it (ex. creating the hip-hop binder).  he claims he's not a drinker but consistently talks about how he doesn't remember certain places he was at because he was so drunk and having fun.  he talks about how other cops were scared but he was excited to be in drug-ridden, violent areas of brooklyn.  that in itself concerns me.  to me, that's like saying that this cop viewed these areas like the board game clue.  he may find it amusing that he caught the killer, but none of these killers, witnesses, and children in the area find their everyday life ""fun.""  it's very easy to criticize one's lifestyle when you don't have to live it on an everyday basis.    5) the man seems to have all of these answers about how the nypd and lapd should operate to be a more productive police force, but there was something he did in this book that only stamped the ""why i hate cops"" attitude into just about everyone who mildly thought it before.  there's a huge no-snitch policy in poverty-stricken areas (and quite a few middle-income areas too, the more the police act a fool)!  every single time he talked about issues within criminal cases, he gave out real names of witnesses, as well as all the information they gave. he talked about buying them food and how so many were cooperative in telling their stories.  but the information he gave may not have all been accessible to the public.  some of the killers got off free, and i don't even understand why he put so much information about what the victims said in this book.  does he think all criminals don't read?  all they need is one friend to say that their name was mentioned in the book, and there's a whole new set of problems for these witnesses.  victims and witnesses risk their lives telling stories about what has happened around them, and a cop documenting all the details in the book does not make anybody feel safer to go running to the cops. if anything, it makes them more hesitant.  just about every chapter, i was shaking my head and thinking ""he can't help it. he's a cop.  he doesn't understand how goofy it is to document this type of information.""  even if it's someone who hasn't been in a situation where they have to be a witness, a cop repeatedly bothering you can work a person's nerves to the point where they don't want to help you simply because they don't like you.  i went to a high school a block away from a police station and was harrassed all the time for unexplainable reasons, even as a reasonably innocent teenage girl.  it's going to take more than the no-snitch rule to get people to help in these communities. cops have to pretty much change their whole attitude before a lot of these people will trust them.    6) he speculates on how hip-hop is becoming organized crime and how jay-z and 50 cent have marketing deals. i don't even understand this comparison.  it's not like these were dudes fresh off the street who walked in rapping and got gymshoes.  they both had to fight their way to the top for these companies to even pay attention to them.  yes, they were both drug dealers in the past. so what?  is every marketing company supposed to look at their background, ignore the fact that they are legit now, and not do business with them? if that's the case, america wouldn't have survived this long. this country was created from thieves and slaveowners.  if wall street can get rich, so can hip-hop.  parker talks about how most fortune 500 companies wouldn't do business with people with this background.  i hate to break it to this dude, but if companies weren't going to get rich off of criminals, america wouldn't be one of the most powerful countries that it is now off of free labor and the attitude ""well, it's all in the past now.""      as i figured, i didn't like this book and it didn't improve my opinion on cops, but when he wasn't talking about how great he was, i did find out some missing information that the media has screwed up in their daily reports. hip-hop cape"	2
"this book is incredible!  this author ""poo-poos"" any idea of conspiracy as if it's in our deep inner mind.  just notice he equates it with ""paranoid"".  does he think bin laden and his gang ""conspired""?  well if you read one of mr. pipes other books, he certainly believes that, so i guess we can say he's paranoid.  conspiracies most likely are natural and normal, an abscence of conspiracy would be contrary to how individuals, nations and institutions work.  mr. pipes ought to know that well.  he's a member of the council on foreign relations, an organization which was founded by j.p. morgan and has ties to the federal reserve bank, which is a private bank: not federal but a cabal of private bankers serving their own best interests.  you can't join the cfr on your own--you must be invited! it's a club of the elite, by the elite for the elite. every high ranking member of the bush admin is cfr: hayden, bush, cheney, rice, rumsfeld, powell, paulson, snow, etc, etc, also so is ms. clinton and many other ruling democrats. is this a coincidence, hardly! compare mr. pipes book to tim carney's ""the big ripoff"", recently hosted on cspan book reviews and available on amzaon.  tim gets close to the target by seeing the symptoms. mr. pipes writing of this book is highly suspect.  one has to question his motives.  it's like the big bad wolf writing a book:  how to raise chickens in a hen house and keep them safe. you would be better reading g. edward griffin's book: creature from jekyll island-a second look at the federal reserve. conspiracy.  no such thing according to this author. let's remove it from the dictionary"	0
"my five-year-old son loves this book.  the first time, i read it out loud to him and his sister.  he has read it alone several times since then.  i think the writing is right on his level - he has tackled tougher books but not gone back to them like this one - and it is long enough that he doesn't finish it in fifteen minutes.  the story sounds to me just like something a kid would think of - for example, how elmer crossed the river full of crocodiles.    i also asked my son what he liked about it, and he said, ""dragons.""  he might have given a longer answer if he hadn't been busy reading the book at the time. wonderful, imaginative"	1

this is one of the best books on fencing writen by an american. it's major weakness is that it often   attempts to teach both foil and epee and the same time . the author does address modern fencing , a subject often ingored. this book is good for the person that knows how to fence and wants some pointers; not a good read for beginners . a good book but  kept me wanting more, for example the author tells nothing of how she took up the sport and what it's done for her. close only 4 of 5 stars. a good book on fencing	2
i own a large collection of hypnosis books and this one has to be the most lame, poorly written and uninformative book on this subject i have come across. if you are a hippy-dippy new age moron this book is for you, but if  you are looking for  a real book on hypnosis, avoid this book or waste your  money. nuff said. the worst self-hypnosis book.	0
i loved the inferno, so i approached this book with the enthusiasm of a gourmand at an all-you-can-eat buffet.  sadly, the bread turned out to be stale, the steak overdone and the desserts moldy. okay. now that i've run that metaphor into the ground, let's talk about vita nuova.  i found it to be pretty darn tedious and highly melodramatic.  the prose is self-indulgent and dry; the poetry, while slightly better, falls into the same camp.  you just want to say to the guy--get a life!  at several points during the book, dante's fellow townspeople mock him because of his constant waterworks and woe-is-me-ing. i sympathized with them, found myself laughing at this whiny, timid little man.  dante, as he portrays himself in this book, is a bore, a sniveling, spoiled child. wake me up when it's over	2
the story-line is ok, even though some unlikely coincidences occur.  but, the writing is very amateurish and full of grammatical, punctuation, and syntax errors (among others).  it was like slogging through quicksand to read it.  the book must have been self-published because no editor would have let it go out with all the errors.    a very good editor could make this an ok book, though not nearly the quality of susan kay's.    don't buy it unless you are a phantom of the opera collector and just must have everything published. could have been good, but it wasn't.	0
first off, there are 356 entries in this book, not 366 like the cover and title indicate.  that huge and glaringly obvious mistake is representative of the lack of attention paid to the rest of the book.  &quot;everyday mind&quot; is a disappointing collection of out-of-context excerpts from magazine articles and book snippets.   there is not even one original entry in the whole book.  the content is quite light for anyone really interested in buddhist thought, let alone anyone interested in really improving their lives.  i wasted fifteen bucks on this one. disappointing collection of magazine and book quotes	0
this book is not only an interesting read, but fun as well!  the pictures detail everything from each step of refurbishing a sailboat, including what tools to use and how to use them.  i just ordered 3 more copies and can't wait to give them to my boating enthusiastic friends!  whether your re-doing a sailboat or not, i would highly recommend this to anybody who's into boating. detailed, interesting and fun how-to book!!	1
i'm so glad i only got this book out of the library.  i would want my money back if i had paid for it!  granted i am only  trying my first recipe from it now (linzer roll cookies), but the directions are contradictory and full of errors.  for instance, the recipe tells you to roll the dough out into one 10 inch square and in the next sentences tell you what to do with the rectangles of dough.  so we go from one square to some rectangles.  so nick, which one is it supposed to be? i guess i'll just have to wing it!  hello, isn't a professional pastry chef supposed to know his stuff?   i'll stick with the king arthur flour, their new cookie book is fabulous as is their complete baking book. disappointed!	0
i am a big dawn fan, so i miss dawn.they could've replaced dawn with someone better than abby. abby is an obnoxious eigth grader who thinks she is so funny. abby shows of that she is so cool. in the book she tries to help her mom and sister ajust to stoneybrook. abby should have never joined the club. kristy is right when she says that abby is a bad baby-sitter. abby should have never joined the club. boo, abby!	2
"when i was in high school in 1960 the united states launched the first discoverer satelite was launched. it was, of course, launched for purely peaceful, scientific purposes.     this book talks about the corona project which had the public cover name 'discoverer.'     years later i was selling high-tech equipment to the government. the buyers were organizations with initials like n-pic and nro. even the initials were secret, and the names national photographic interpretation center and national reconnaissance office were so far into the 'black' that they weren't even mentioned.     this book says that the information in it has been cleared for release by these very organizations.     once in a meeting someone mentioned 'keyhole.' i said, ""what."" he shut up really quickly.     most of this book consists of pages that were marked ""top secret - talent - keyhole."" talent is imagery. keyhole is the camera system (designed by polaroid).     i later was talking to an air force pilot who had been transferred to hawaii. when he got there he asked another officer what the deal was. he was told, ""oh, we fly out to a spot in the pacific and we use a hook system on the plane to catch a parachute out of the air that is lowering a capsule that has been ejected from a satellite up in space."" what a wise ass, he thought until he found out that that was what they were really doing.     the corona images are now available for anyone to use. but now their biggest utility is to examine what has happened over the forty five years since they were taken.     this book is the first released on corona, it consists of the original reports written at the time, declassified but with certain parts blacked out. it's the original scoop. declassified data from our time"	1
cosmos no es un libro rápido, lleno de situaciones que nos ponen  a pasar hojas y hojas de manera frenética. cosmos es un libro acerca de la vida, de cómo entendernos, de observar cada cosa como si en cada imagen, cada olor, cada movimiento encontraramos el sentido verdadero de vivir. es un libro lento pero rico en descripciones. y es cierto lo que dice la reseña digitial, este libro tiene su lado surrealista. no es una novela en donde pasarán mil cosas, las cosas pasarán en usted si le llega a gustar el libro. sentidos agudos	2

i have great respect for charles jencks as an architect, and as a critic of art relating to such. therefore the book should be retitled, what is postmodern architecture? or what is everything about post-modernism except  the art? the main focus seems to be on the industrial world which created  the art, rather then the art. seems hardly revolutionary or even relevant  since everyone and their brother and sister has written on that subject  since 1820. i was hoping for something which would address the art, but i  was sorely disappointed. the constant focus on the world around the  buildings of postmodernism dragged and was inebriatingly dull (it got to  the point where the author was forced to contradict himself to make the  book interesting). the focus of postmoderism was once architecture,  however, now the focus has shifted, it seems everyone except the academics  know this. not only was his sections on art and literature stupid, but  incorrect, and blunderingly light. i expected more from jencks, being the  great mind of the century he was. if you want to know anything helpful and  relevant pretaining to post modernism today, do not read this book. but hey  if you want to know about your father's post modernism, read this book. the proponents of postmodernism are excrutiatingly overrated	0
"an unhappily married and mistreated preacher's wife lets us in on the sad and lonely existence of a pastor's wife.  king did a good job of showing how pastors' wives are expected to please and perform at inhuman levels.    i wasn't happy with the ending (dean's tawrdriness seemed out of character); i wish she could have left on her own terms, rather than being basically run out of town.  her behavior lessened the reader's pleasure in seeing pious, ambitious, ben's probable career nomination nix.  augusta's manic personality was enjoyable and needed for the story; sometimes it takes a ""big"" personality to help us break old habits and get out of ruts and she did that for dean.    a good read, just wish dean could have finally told ben and the church what she really thought of them, left town, and then figured out her relationship with maddox... in an above-board kind of way.  dean deserved to leave that snake pit with her head held high, not running with her tail between her legs. a  look into the impossible life of a preacher's wife...."	2
after reading kingston's &quot;the woman warrior,&quot; i thought i'd read &quot;china men.&quot;  i am not disapointed at all.  &quot;china men&quot; is an excellent biographical work that recounts the lives of chinese men in america from the 1840s to the vietnam war.  although kingston uses as much  chinese myth in this book as she does in &quot;the woman warrior,&quot; she  apparently decided to keep the mythology and biography more separated.   even so, kingston's stories and the way in which she recounts them is  absolutely splendid. a great compliment to kingston's &quot;the woman warrior&quot;	1
&quot;trucks,&quot; by byron barton, is an educational treat for the youngest readers. a very simple text accompanies colorful illustrations of many kinds of trucks. we see a garbage truck, delivery truck, tow truck, dump truck, cement mixer, and more. the artwork of this book is distinctive: the crisp illustrations have an almost mathematical precision to them, and are rich in contrasting colors. i give the book an enthusiastic recommendation. a treasury of trucks for the beginning reader	1
this book was a great book. i like the way trent was helped by nick. one thing i didn't like was the violence. i am not a big fan of basketball, or any other sport, but this book really touched me. i would recommend this book to anyone even if they aren't a lover of sports. that is what i thought about night hoops.        sunny block. night  hoops	0
i thought while reading this book how thoroughly done it was. i thought about how much i loved all in the family, how connected i felt to each character, how i identified with mike, gloria, edith and even archie. how real it was to me. when a piece of literature, brings back all of those feelings and memories, it is something to remember. pictures, stories, archie-isms and an episode guide are just a few things that make up this book. i recommend it to all archie bunker fans and haters alike. this book is one of the best documentations of characters you love to hate, that i have ever come across. boy the way glenn miller played, books that are a hit today!	1
this really is a comprehensive, excellent instruction book and it is appropriate for people at all levels of cake decorating experience.  toba garrett covers everything from start to finish and at the end of each lesson she provides a self-quiz that will help you see how much you have learned, practice each technique and make sure you understand the terminology that goes with this exciting career/hobby.    i teach cake decorating at a local craft store and i own my own cake decorating business and toba is an inspiration and my absolute favorite cake decorator.  if you want to learn anything about the art of cake decorating, this book is worth the price!  it could replace all the other cake books in my library all at once.  oh - and the recipes are fabulous too!  try the chocolate fudge cake recipe if you like chocolate cake, it's out of this world.    i want to mention that the recipes have the ingredient measurements for both a 5-6 quart mixer and a 20 quart mixer for those who are starting a kitchen with bigger equipment. fabulous	1
this book 'the resurrection'..the 'title is a way off does not specify &quot;the resurrection of 'whom' what, who? quite misleading in the 'title' this book contains a paraphrase legalistic view of someone?  by the name of  jesus christ (inside the book) who is this someone? popularistic  homogenous personality of the ad;s era, who resurrected in an abnormal  manner, irrational or modelistic super natural sensationalism?  this  unequal phenomenon of th ad era does not quite interpret an invasion of  ethiologial or methodolagical interpretation in any form or manner.   precautiosly, hank h. (the author) of this 'strange' book, depicts a man  2thous years ago who was a 'super-artistic' human walking around the earth  realm announcing and denouncing his own fate, then 'resurrects' from the  dead?  quite symbolic and quite 'phenomenal', however, hank h. (the  author) does not quite inscripts the powers involving this 'super-natural'  heroes of the other decades and eras ad.  the author needs more research  inside this man called 'jesus-christ', how a super-natural power 'raised'  him and made him a 'normal' human again.  this jesus christ, hank portrays,  has to have an incontrollable humanistic inside his 'human' potentials,  physically, a human-being' after burial cannot in any form or manner  resurrect from the grave.  hank h.

i stumbled on liza picard's books quite by chance. after looking at the publishing date in some of the books it is apparent some of them have been around for several years. i am now recommending them to anyone and everyone and i am so glad i stumbled across the first one i read  on a rainy afternoon, lonely and far away from home. i have now read them all.    as soon as you start to read the book it becomes apparent that the author is passionate about her subject and wants the reader to enjoy the reading experience as much as she has in the writing of it. liza picard presents an enthralling picture of how life in london was really lived in the 1600s: the houses and streets, gardens and parks, cooking, clothes and jewellery, cosmetics, hairdressing, housework, laundry and shopping, medicine and dentistry, sex, education, hobbies, etiquette, law and crime, religion and popular beliefs. to anyone who has not read the author's books perhaps these subjects seem boring and mundane, but they are written about with such knowledge and wit that they literally come to life in the readers imagination.    liza picard was born in 1927. she read law and qualified as a barrister but did not practice. quite where she gleaned all this information from i am not sure. that it was a labour of love is obvious to anyone who reads her books and i for one am grateful. london from 1660-1670	1

as expected, anything coming from victor ostrovsky will be negative and against israel. the book is filled with real events, which the author dramatically changed and turned israel responsible for them. no wonder this book is banned in israel. in fact, because of the ban, many people believe that this book has true accounts of mossad activities. true, the book gets interesting, but the author's motive to run down the israel for everything happening around the world spoils it. this book is a perfect example of blaming a country and its intelligence agency for your own mistakes. i absolutely agree with j. a magill's review, this book has no credible source of information, except the fact that ostrovsky once worked for mossad.     vindictiveness is the word behind this book. absolutely one sided, and nothing to prove what author says. all i can say is that i want my money and most importantly my time back. i doubt if i can have either. one sided view.	0
this book is far too biased to be taken seriously.  throughout the book it appears that the author has an axe to grind and makes it abundantly clear that rudy is not one of his faviorite people.  save your money and buy a book about mayor guiliani that is writen by someone who presents more balance. angry	0
this book was such a relief because it covered classroom discipline, from the beginning, without talking down to the reader. the chapters are organized so that you can implement the methods right away, in a useful sequence without becoming overwhelmed. you need to read this book if you fear you are a pushover in the classroom. i have used these methods in a multicultural classroom with more than half of my students as non-native english speakers. it really works! there is a tremendous feeling of respect between everyone in the classroom. i was especially pleased with the effect on one of my students who was severely abused as a child and who grew up very untrusting in foster homes, etc. in september, he was violent with himself and with other children, striking classroom objects or people when he was angry. other teachers are amazed at how much he has changed since the beginning of the school year. i owe so much to the advice in this book. informative and precise instructions	1

apparently the reviewer from pw read a different book from the one lisa rogak wrote.... her book on atkins was funny, juicy,informative... and really a tribute to the man who was so ahead of his time.   i loved the different faces of atkins revealed, the surprising and sometimes a little shocking facets of the man's personality.  also, revealing the fact that atkins was a proponent of alternative medicine left me wanting to know more.   atkins was a risk taker, a man who dared to be different.   rogak gives us all the personal tidbits that existed behind the public persona who was that man.  i love the diet... and i love rogak's book!. what book are you reading?	2
i agree that this book is absolutely essential to lawschool or practicing law. that's what makes even more horrible!!! i studied english all through college, and relied on the mla handbook, which is great!! why can't the bluebook people hire the mla people to come up with a legal reference book that is well-organized and not utterly confusing!! of course, this review is worthless, b/c if you plan on going to lawschool, working as a paralegal, or doing anything legal, the bluebook is a must have, and there's no way getting around it. another ploy to ensure that the layman must hire an attorney	0
"stenger believes hill is guilty from the start and tries to make him out to be a common criminal. while joe is no choir boy the truth is stranger than fiction. little is known of hill's buddy otto applequist, but over the years more facts have been uncovered about this man's fascinating life. not the ... son of a swedish minister but one of many sons of a working class family. an immigrant who becomes disillusioned with the american dream after he finds, instead of streets paved with gold, only forests, mines, docks, and streets covered with the blood of his fellow workers. not a romantic bandit, but a revolutionary who chose to use his death sentence to bring the cause of labor to the forefront. if you want a balanced book about him get joe hill by gibbs smith.

"having enjoyed kellerman's delaware stories,i happened on this one and was stunned by his cultural/racial bias.  it is astounding how often the arabs, turks, bedouins, muslims are described as ""sweat stained,"" ""filthy,"" ""lazy"" and ""shiftless.""  the idiot arab boy and the dishonest shop keepers are typical.  the israelis are always industrious, clean, eager to do the job. the ""good"" arab detective, mahoud, isn't even muslim--he's christian!  the description of the 1947 and 1967 wars are difficult to consume, knowing the complexity of the issues then.  this was an old (1988) book, and one hopes that kellerman will stick to his detective/psychologist stories. anti-muslim seems to be ok"	2

"i am disappointed with this cookbook. i was looking for a basic cookbook to explain times and techniques to cook standard items in a toaster oven. what i call the ""nitty gritty"" of using a toaster oven. obviously i am wrong, the book contains nothing basic, standard or instructional about using a toaster oven. nitty gritty but not much!"	2
as was described in other reviews, this book in big, unorganized heap of too short anecdotes (half page), which become boring very quickly. one of worst kind of popular science book. may be her talent are better suited for other fields. bunch of too short anecdotes	0
a lot of character exploration in this collection.  a lot of the x-men being the young people they are have started to couple up.  there are also some breaks with colossus and nightcrawler having problems after colossus has come out.  the major storyling is the phoenix.  is jean grey the phoenix?  i can't say without spoiling it, but it does not follow the path of the traditional marvel universe.  overall it was a good story, the artwork is a but uneven at times, but it works for the most part. first	2
"scholarship in the field of islamic studies has improved steadily since the 1970's. whereas islam was often viewed as a monolith, and from an orientalist perspective, current scholarship has been more informed of the realities of the religion. unfortunately recent popular media and writing has tended to reverse this positive trend and outlook. many books, articles and classes are back to portraying islam and muslims in terms of divisive characterizations. muslims tend to be viewed as ""fundamentalist"", modernist or opposed to western civilization. the spiritual dimension of the religion, sufism, is often viewed as outside the core foundations of the religion. the divisive perceptions by both muslims and non-muslims reflect some actual situations but do not contribute to much needed mutual understanding.  the authors of this work demonstrate that only with an integrated approach, which includes the depth of the spiritual tradition within islam, may issues in the current crisis be addressed and lasting solutions found.   what is unique about this book is that it explains the current situation and crisis we are facing (particularly as a result of the terrible tragedy of september 11th) based on a more complete understanding of the islamic intellectual tradition. this tradition always refers back to a metaphysical, meta-historical reality defined not only by islamic revelation, but by all the world's great religious traditions. it would be easier to simply state positive aspects of islam without rising to the challenge of addressing the specific problems, issues and negative images the western media has confronted muslims with. it is even more rare to see these issues addressed from the perspective of a long-standing intellectual tradition based on sacred texts and writings of eminent figures in the past and modern eras. the authors in this book manage to incorporate sound scholarship and critical analysis using the resources of the spiritual and intellectual tradition of islam to address the difficult questions now challenging the islamic view.  the book edited by joseph lumbard includes: a foreword by seyyed hossein nasr; a qur'anic analysis of the term ""jihad"" by david dakake; a study of the decline of knowledge based on the islamic intellectual tradition of ""ihsan"" by joseph lumbard;  a response to modern secularism by fuad naeem; an analysis of the spirit of jihad by reza shah-kazemi; a view of the roots of modern misconceptions of islam by ibrahim kalin; an application of game theory as a strategy for dealing with the politics of terrorism by waleed el-ansary; a muslim response to the social, economic and political impacts of globalization by ejaz akram; and a perspective on the effects of fanaticism on the muslim community by t. j. winter.  this work constitutes a refreshing collection of articles that succeed in stimulating the debate on the current world crisis and in taking account of the problems from an integral approach to islam. bright new scholarship based on intellectual tradition"	1
i read the true story of the my lia massacre when it first came out, and then knew why when we came back we were called baby killers. now that i have read this book on my lia i wonder how they let something like that happen and what makes me mad is that nothing more has been done about the people that done it all. i personelly think that all the people that took part should be put in jail and left there, but other then that it was an excellent book to read. excellent reading	1
this book is pretty lame compared to other texts on the market today. the yi jin jing description is terrible and of no use what so ever. neither is the shaolin 5 animals forms that are discribed in minute proportions. i don't care what the history of the manuscripts are, this book offers no definitive information. it is very vague and elementary, a lot like smith's other books. the fighting methods shown are a poor representation of shaolin skills. the true essence of shaolin is beyond any manuscript, let alone a hoax manuscrpit from taiwan, which is the inspiration for this book. typical robert smith mush	2
an analysis of this sort was sorely needed. this book is factual in addition to being cute. i would highly recommend it to anyone. great book!	2
in women &amp; christianity, educator and author mary malone examines the chronic and pervasive ambivalence towards women throughout the first thousand years of christianity. while women from the very beginnings of the christian church have been graced, called, inspired, and canonized down through the centuries, they have also been excluded and even oppressed by clergy and other leaders of the christian community who cited scripture and christian tradition (including apocryphal and gnostic literatures) as the justifying source of their discrimination. very highly recommended for women's studies and students of christian history from 30 c.e. to 1002 c.e. (the &quot;dateline&quot; section is particularly noteworthy), women &amp; christianity showcases both the persistent courage and the innovative quality of women's lives, as well as offering a critical analysis of previous conventional histories. the clear emphasis throughout is the enduring importance of women's contributions to the creation of western culture in general, and the evolving christian community in particular. examines the chronic and pervasive ambivalence towards women	1
"i've seen several mentions of grainy photos, and they are grainy, however that is the least of the problems with this book.    first of all many of the figures have been traced out from the background the photo was taken with and pasted onto a plain white background, causing multiple problems, like persepctive and flat or squished body surfaces where the models were originally sitting or lying on something.  the ""cutting and pasting"" is sloppily done, and in many of the photos the tips of toes and fingers have been cut off, very annoying.    secondly, there are several photographs that take up two pages...but this is a bound book, so the entire center of the body is not visible, and because a portion is in the binding even the countour is not usable.  in additon to the two page layouts, there are multiple other figures that fall directly in the center of the book, and are rendered unusable by the binding.  the only thing i can figure is that this was originally a spiral bound book, or had pull out pages, like a magazine centerfold.  i can't imagine someone would intentionally publish a book with such an awful layout.    lastly, some of the ""motion"" figures are cheats.  one in particular is clearly a man laying on something propped up on a pillow, but he has been cut and pasted as though it were an upright pose...maybe that explains why so many found the poses ""unatural"".  that wouldn't be a big deal if the book wasn't called ""the figure in motion"", and was maybe titled ""some figures in motion, and some sedentary but turned to appear as though they were in motion.""    couldn't give it no stars, as i will use some of the photos, but my money could most certainly have been better spent. several problems"	2
"if you want to consult the first folio, get a facsimile.  freeman's ""editions"" are not only pointless, they are profoundly misleading: only someone who was completely ignorant about jacobean book-production could possibly suppose that the vagaries of f1 represent a meticulous adherence to shakespeare's intentions.  in the matter of lineation, for example, charlton hinman long ago showed that compositors would divide their copy into lines to suit their own convenience -- i.e. to take up more or less space as the process of ""casting off"" required. pointless and misleading"	0
"i picked up this o'conner book because every once in awhile i hear about her being ""the definitive voice of the south"" or ""very disturbing"" - i like disturbing and since i'm not overly familiar with the south, the definitive voice of it seems a good place to start.  but i just couldn't do it.  i read maybe 4 stories before i had to put it down for good.  i found the characterizations sophomoric and, well -- i suspect the overt, unsubtle, judgemental observations constantly being offered were snide parody, read in this day of self-consciousness they read like pandering to the lowest common denominator.    timely, maybe.  timeless, it's not. a good book is hard to find"	2
first off, i recommend that you buy this book if you are at all interested in knife fighting. this is one of the first and one of the classical american books on knife fighting. it covers all of the basic techniques  that american forces have used for many, many years. at the same time, this  book is a little short on techniques, and it is entirely absent the escrima  techniques that have become very popular over the past couple of decades.  if you don't look at this book as everything for everybody, you will find  it a very good buy and not be disappointed. on the other hand, if you're  looking for the snappiest way to open and close your balisong, you're going  to have to look elsewhere, as this book was written before that time. a classical if a bit dated primer on knife fighting	2
mr. gilkerson has written something wonderful here; even 50 pages in and at the tender age of 40+ i was enjoying the ride. this is one fun book to read, and aside from some of the nautical terms used, seems very appropriate for an early adolescent. also, as a hobby pirate historian, i can fully appreciate what the author has done in providing a background for the history of piracy in his narrative. he has provided this history in what i consider to be a very engaging manner; a manner that will drag the younger reader along entertainingly and educationally. three hundred plus pages later, i was just as engaged as the author wound up his narrative.    there are only a couple of minor things that could have been included to help the young reader: 1) a glossary of terms, 2) a labeled image of ship rigging, and 3) a collected bibliography for further reading. in the end, those are fairly minor points when considered in the context of the overall entertainment value of the book. my hearty thanks to william gilkerson for entertaining me with this splendid tale. p-. return of charles johnson	1
"after the 1700s, this play fell into obscurity. it was later revived in the mid 1900s. its period of obscurity does not surprise me. believe me, i am a champion for shakespeare's underrated ""timon of athens"" and ""coriolanus."" i honestly tried to like this play, but i was forced to concur with the great isaac asimov who said: ""though it ends happily and is therefore technically a comedy, it lacks a carefree fun and happiness of the previous comedies. it is, indeed, rather an unpleasant play..."" well, onto the play. we meet the widowed countess, her son bertram, and the elder lafew. we learn that the king is ill and quite possibly terminal. possibly, helena's father could have cured the king, but alas, he is dead. the countess gives bertram some advice that is not so far from the advice polonius gave ophelia. (though the bumbling polonius ends up being easier to like!) helena loves bertram, but feels beneath him and contemplates virginity. one comical moment is when parolles reveals that in a way, virginity is a form of vain self love. later, helena cures the king, and helena asks for bertram as a husband. now this is where i have a problem. bertram is made out to be a villain. but how can we possibly not sympathize with him? maybe helena deserves something for saving the king, but does she really have the right to impose marriage on someone who doesn't like her? well, bertram is forced to go through with the marriage, but he quickly decides to help florence against siena. poor parolles who knows this forced marriage was unethical is constantly made a subject of ridicule in this play. this is where i have another problem. rather than the clever misunderstandings of ""the comedy of errors,"" the clever marital confrontations and errors in ""midsummer night's dream,"" or the comical and clever passages from jaques in ""as you like it,"" the comedy in ""all's well that ends well"" is reduced to the lowest possible form. (flat out ridicule! it is interesting that in the word ridicule, we have the letters for cruel, but i am digressing.) in one decent elemenet of comedy, bertram makes it clear that he would rather go to war than lie with his wife. (and perhaps in time, bertram can appeal to the king to release him from this marriage. it wouldn't be unheard of.) one interesting thing is that bertram remains honorable in the sense that he does not 'ravish' helena. he doesn't love her, and therefore will not engage in sex. it is rather repulsive on his mother's part how she fails to understand the situation. even if she was on helena's side, she might at least understand bertram's frustration in that he did not consent to the marriage. (and possibly try to at least talk things over in hopes of coming to a peaceful solution.) but no. she just rants and raves. later the countess reads a letter from helena stating that she will leave so bertram can come home from the war. this throws bertram's mother into yet another rage on helena's behalf, and perhaps moves the reader into sympathy with helena. that is, until our good old uncle isaac asimov points out the hypocrisy of helena: ""helena is not quite as unselfish as she is presenting herself to be. she does not go to the shrine at all but sneaks off to florence in disguise as a pilgrim hoping that she may yet return her reluctant husband."" well, onward. in florence, helena meets with diana (whom bertram loves). and helena thinks she can trick bertram into making her pregnant. we then have the cruel practical joke on parolles where he is blindfolded and threatened to reveal military secrets (to friendly forces of course) or else. perhaps even shakespeare felt bad over this scene as he has parolles say: ""who can not be crushed with a plot?"" (4.3.340). we also see bertram try to win the affections of diana. diana of course feels nothing for bertram. but again, the hypocrisy of the play is prevalent. if we accept the fact that bertram should respect diana's wishes that she doesn't love him, how do we account for the fact that helena imposed an unwanted marriage on bertram? but of course diana consents to meet bertram and of course it will really be helena who meets him. but even tricking bertram into getting her pregnant is not enough. helena decides to throw a sympathy party for herself by spreading the word of her death back home. now in ""much ado about nothing,"" hero had a valid excuse for staging her death. she was humiliated and disgraced in front of several people for something she was totally innocent of. but helena was the one who imposed an unwanted marriage on bertram, and she still wants a sympathy party. one redeeming element of the play is that lafew shows some sympathy for the disgraced parolles and offers him a job. and of course, in the end bertram feels bad over helena's staged death and is happy to see her alive again. helena may very well be the britney spears of shakespeare's characters. uncle isaac  asimov tells it as it is.

in recent years, routledge has gone from consistently producing excellent language courses to producing some excellent courses and some bad courses. unfortunately, colloquial catalan is a prime example of the very worst colloquial courses.     the main error in this course is the fact that it's exceptionally limited. after completing some of the more extensive colloquial courses, you will master the grammar of the language and have a solid basic vocabulary. colloquial courses like colloquial italian, colloquial czech, colloquial albanian or colloquial icelandic list over 2000 words. the average colloquial courses list 1000-1500 words. in sharp contrast, colloquial catalan doesn't even reach 600 words!     in my opinion, the colloquial courses are often a better option than teach yourself courses, but that's not the case with catalan. teach yourself catalan will teach you more than twice as much as colloquial catalan. look for teach yourself catalan	0
this is an amazing, beautifully written first novel. not only is the plot first rate, the characters are drawn with a rare degree of perception and even compassion. the relationships are realistic and change as the investigation proceeds and when the murderer is caught. the dialogue is natural, and reflects the personality of the character speaking.    there is also wonderful humor in the descriptions and the dialogue.    this is the mystery to lend the friends who think mysteries are shallow, formulaic and generally not worth wasting time on. this is the book to lend to friends who love good writing.     i can't wait for the next. incredibly good writing	1
this book has given my daughter and me more info on this disease than any doctor has been able to do.  the book has given my daughter encouragement that she can live with this syndrome and that she can make her life better if she takes the metformin and gets her body moving.  the info on food has helped sooooooo much.  thank you for this book!!!!!. pcos	1
"if you are that ""dummy"" who wants to know how to build a web-site, then this is not the book for you. it tells you hardly how to build, it tells more about links which can help you making your web-site look more cool. you have to have some html cq dreamweaver experience to understand the context of what the writer wants to clarify.  by reading the book and going through the enclosed cd rom with ty-out software, i soon came to the conclusion that the title of the book is somewhat misleading. see comments above why.    if you are that ""dummy"" who has not a single thread of  knowledge about building web-sites, then do not buy this book.  not giving it 1 star (but i was close), there are some interesting chapters in this reference giude, but typing what you want to have inside your web-site (links and related web-sites with loads of info what comprises around 50% of the book). you will get the same information from any search engine.    recommendation: concentrate first on a book, that teaches you the basic html-programming language, continue then with either a dreamweaver/frontpage manual. you're much better off.. not the ""building web-site guide"" you may look for"	2

despite the praise heaped on this text, i can't help feeling that bernard faure has been constructing the 'straw men' other readers have spotted. it is by no means certain that the ch'an (zen) tradition has functioned as faure suggests. why, for instance, set up the 'anti-scriptural'  argument - only to concede - on proper investigation, that it is a myth? there are enough commentaries - on the sutras, by zen monks, to make this sort of thing seem pointless. sorry, but lets place trust in those deluded masters of old - and stay unenlightened, faure style. perhaps, just rhetoric!	2
until now, i'd not been not all that familiar or appreciative of graphic novels. i gave this book a try because i was interested in its jewish content.  after reading it, i was surprised to learn that this was the first graphic novel in book form and that will eisner was a pioneer in his field.      eisner's drawings are  magnificent, and the book's content noteworthy and familiar.  i like the idea of taking everyday characters and telling a story with pictures and dialogue.  i especially like the tidbits of history that preceed each chapter and the amazing detail in the sketches of the tenement buildings and the scenery (especially the falling rain). perhaps comics are not just for kids after all. wow!	1
i found this to be a good book on translating the tools of manufacturing to an office environment. it communicates all of the basics that are required.    i've attended one of this consulting group's manufacturing classes.  i found them to be dead on.  i like the way they handled the accounting/cost/metric relationship to lean production.  basically, the current accounting standards will cause you to do things in opposition to what lean principles will have you do.    in some other office scenarios, i think this more traditional approach will not have all the pieces or tools required.  i work in an industry where order entry is significantly more complex than the examples presented, a much higher degree of interaction with other players is required, and rework loops are significant part of the process (customer driven rework).  anitech has an approach that tracks the information flow surrounding the work process, while applying the same lean techniques that are presented in this book.      tracking the information flow provides an opportunity to sort out, automate, and lean out that information flow.  there is tremendous leverage in this concept. vsm for the office	2
i first read clavell's shogun when i was twelve years and it sparked within me a life long interest in east-asian culture. in many ways he helped bring me to japan, where i have lived for a total of eight years. however after reading his works for many years, i was quite bored with gaijin, which i never finished. i perused through the book looking for interesting points but found little. his messages in his other works were repetitive in this one. amongst them are his criticisms of western culture through an asian perspective. i grew tired of hearing how sexually repressed white-anglo-saxon-protestants are when compared to their asian counter-parts, and thought my reading time was too precious to sit through another lengthy reading of how east meets west. some of my friends in japan have read gaijin and liked it; but after owing so much to this writer, i am sorry that i could not say more of this work. couldn't finish it.	0

this is a five-star classic, and for the price can't be beat.  the author covers selection, use and maintenace of dutch ovens, as well as providing a good mix of recipe types (fish, poultry, deserts, etc.).  i especially recommend the fish and rice recipe. dutch oven use and care, plus varied recipes	1
"richard laymon is one of those writers that some people have a hard time admitting that they really like. having read over a dozen of his novels i have to agree with dean koontz that you will have a ""good time with anything he writes."" although his plot lines tend to push the limits of probability, the strength of his characters add a verismilitude to his novels that have you wanting to believe this could happen. that is the basic foundation of this book which has six college students chasing after buried treasure in the wilderness after receiving some very accurate and very spooky instructions from a ouija board. now there are very few authors that could take such an almost lame premise like this a build a very suspenseful novel around it- but laymon, as usual, pulls it off. if you are looking for a fast-moving, in your face, page-turning novel and are somewhat willing to suspend your beliefs for a while then you will enjoy this book. i guess reading laymon is like riding a roller coaster, you just pay your money, hang on and enjoy the ride. solid spooky laymon"	2
persia vanderbilt has grown tiresome for me.  the endless self-absorbtion of the character has worn out its welcome.  more emphasis on the town, her auntie, the shop and the plot would be welcome.  less emphasis on how toned and fit persia is, and much less description about what she's wearing might make me come back.  as much as i hate to say it, it was a struggle to get through the book. may be verging on formulaic	2
"i've read several other mysteries by this author, but was quite disappointed in this one. the writing seemed ""padded""--i.e. paragraph after paragraph that did nothing to advance the plot.     the plot itself was okay, but certainly not exceptional, and some of it wasn't even believable. for example,although there was some explanation for the seemingly total imcompetence by the local police department (understaffing), the idea that even a rookie (much less the police chief) would miss so many of the pertinent and obvious clues that an untrained 32 yr old shop owner ferreted out seems more than a little farfetched.    another part of the plot that strained even the most willing suspension of disbelief is the handling of the dv incidents by the police. again, only the most incompetent of professionals would have handled the case they way it was.    all in all, this novel was not one i'd recommend to anyone. disappointing!"	2

"the crumbling wall against tyranny is the most interesting book that i've ever seen on the american revolution, our sytem of government, and the current state of affairs. the book is authorative, yet humorous at times. complicated legal concepts are explained in terms that i, a mere high school/trade school grad, can easily understand. i was particularly impressed with the authors ability to relate experiences of growing up in a small town to our national government(chapters 8&9). i, too, grew up in such a small town, albeit my small town was 500 miles away and considerably colder, yet it seemed the same as my little town. in summary, i was very impressed with ""the  crumbling wall against tyranny"" and i would recommend it to any one interested in american government especialy the parents of students who are studying or will be studying the constituion. the crumbling wall against tyranny: a/k/a the united states "	1
although vestal establishes his credibility as a researcher, it is not enough to research well; one must also be a writer, and vestal's embarrassing attempts to mimic bridger's speech is a travesty.  from inane, trite cliches to ungrammatical and unmusical diction, it is clear that vestal needed a much stronger editor.  recommended only for those who can ignore the non-standard grammar and abyssmal writing or who are interested only in the research. embarrassingly inept writing	0
there is little to respect about this book.  if you are looking for factual, organized and informed writing, look elsewhere.  i found the conjecture regarding tesla being an atlantean engineer, incarnate; and the co-founder (with marconi) of a city of the future in south america -- well i'm sorry, but who needs this.  on the other hand, the photos of ufos were as good as any i have seen.  on the plus side, the copied material (tesla letters, patents and court transcripts) was interesting. bad book for lots of money	0

this book really made me take a step back and look at my life and how i have wasted a lot of it with meaningless task that i don't even enjoy. it teaches you to pay attention and devote your time to the things that really matter. i highly recommend this book for anyone who like myself leads a hurried life or feels like they have forgotten what brings them joy. buy this book!. highly recommended	2
an abundance of full-color plates and numerous black-and-white photographs made this book worth the modest price.  the text is awkward. it sounds as if english is not the author's first language and certain elements of carelessness in the writing suggest that the author was more concerned with the manuscript deadline than scholarship. picasso's own words, appearing as blocked quotes in the margins are not dated, nor sources given. the reader is not able to chronologically trace the change in philosophy reflected in his words. the text also suffers from an inordinate number of typographical errors. walther's poorly disguised gut reaction of disgust in describing some of picasso's work may reflect the reaction his early critics felt in viewing some of his paintings. walther uses words such as &quot;horror,&quot; &quot;grotesque,&quot; &quot;misshapen,&quot; and &quot;ugly,&quot; at one point writing, &quot;picasso wanted to destroy absolutely everything.&quot. poorly executed text; good collection of color plates	2
impress your friends.  intimidate your enemies.  buy this book!!!    i must echo the sentiments of an earlier reviewer.  i was a returning college student in my late twenties.  i had to take several remedial courses just to bring myself up to speed in math and english.  between the techniques in this book (mainly mind mapping), meditation and subliminal memory tapes (the last two are not in this book) i finished my second semester with three a's and two b's.  also, i made the deans list.      the section on speed-reading was so great; college was the first time in my entire life that i could read so fast i actually had time to go over my answers and check for any possible errors.  i rarely found any.      if you are in a super hurry to improve your memory for testing, i suggest skipping to the mind map section.  however, you really should go back when you have more time and read the whole book!!. so good, it should be illegal!!!	1
ordinary children, extraordinary teachers has inspired me to be a better parent and teacher to my two children. marva first let the children know that she cared about them and that she would not let them fail even when  the other schools have washed their hands of the child. it was as if i were  a student in marva's class. i was so encourage to first, complete the book,  i could not put it down, as i read i would practice the techniques on my  children, for example my six grade son was still struggling with his  multiplcations facts, he had a test to complete 100 problems in 4 min. i  call my son a scholar and had him practice over and over the same test.   each practice test he got better and better, he passed the test and felt  really proud.he is bringing his c's to b's and his b's to a's.  i learned  you have to meet the child where he is.  thank you marva for your care,  concern, inspiration and motivation. and keep teaching and writing. encourage children, students and selves to be the very best	1
"i got this as a gift from my son, since i had just visited tuscany last year and loved the food. i am an experienced gourmet cook. this book needed a test kitchen in the worst way. i tried two recipes: one for polenta (as basic as pasta) and a garbanzo bean bread. the proportions for both were totally wrong. the polenta balled up in the pan, and the ""flat bread"" was like a soft egg dish. i checked in one of my favorite chef cookbooks (sheila lukins of silver palate fame) and the proportions were very different for the polenta. the other recipe couldn't find anywhere. i'm donating this one to the library for the friends of the library sale. for the coffee table, not the kitchen"	0

you almost feel sorry for the author.  draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations.  more worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at harvard.  and that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment.  it's written in a fairly convincing pidgin english, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief.  it also feels entirely formulaic.  it goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration.  there's no doubt that iweala can write.  i hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life.  i'd risk buying another book of his. here we go again.	2
"""the hitler book"", a posthumous biography of hitler personally prepared for stalin, is of interest only as a historical curiosity and for the insight it provides into the strange political dynamics of postwar stalinist russia. interestingly enough, and contrary to press reports and the claims of the researchers in question, this book was not recently ""discovered"" by a couple of german scholars digging around the russian archives. david irving used this dossier in the 1960s when writing his magnificent ""hitler's war"", which is_the_book i would recommend for those interested in a life of hitler, particularly his years in power.    based on the interrogations of otto guensche and heinz linge (hitler's ss adjutant and manservant respectively), this book covers most of the major events of hitler's life more or less accurately, but should not be taken as an authoritative work of history. it's a gossipy, biographical caricature based on both public knowledge and the torture-induced testimonies of a butler and an aide. that's not to say that guensche's and linge's testimony shouldn't be trusted, but two low-level witnesses do not a biography make and, in any case, their information should be compared with what they freely told western authors, like david irving and james o'donnell, after their decade in soviet captivity. this book reveals no new information, and is also marred by the fact that it shamelessly panders to the prejudices and paranoia of its very important audience of one: josef stalin. it obviously makes no mention of the ribbentrop/molotov pact and subsequent soviet expansion into poland, finland, romania and the baltic states, and certainly doesn't deal with soviet agressive intentions toward germany or the reasons for the disasters of 1941. its portrait of hitler sticks to the wartime propaganda line, showing him as a feral, rug-chewing, cowardly maniac. and while the soviet union did indeed bear the brunt of the fighting against nazi germany, this book seriously downplays the anglo-american contribution, deprecates the bravery and effectiveness of their troops and even accuses the western allies of trying to negotiate a separate peace with hitler and of not bombing armaments factories whose weapons they knew would be used exclusively against the soviets. it's an interesting look into the dark maze of stalinist psychology, but is not the source to consult for a legitimate hitler biography. somewhat interesting but hardly a ""must-read"""	2
"i read all the reviews before purchasing this book and they are totally wrong!! this is by far the worst cookbook i ever bought.  for starters the cover is the end of the color pages. the whole thing is mono-tone with no color what-so-ever.   the recipes consist of items that an everyday working mom couldnt find or afford!  like swordfish, lamb, tampanade sauce, kasseri and gorgonzola cheese, etc. to name a few.  of all the recipes, i think i would maybe only try 3 and they are similar recipes to those i can get off the internet for free.  in addition  several recipes have a sauce that goes with it and it never gives the sauce recipe on the same page.  in fact it doesnt even tell you where to find the recipe.  at the end of the book you discover the ""sauces""  finally...  i am re-listing this book which i got less than 8 hours ago to resell...horrible.. do not believe other reviews!!!"	0
"i hated this book.  this family has two girls, racie and jaynell.  rachie is a girly-girl and jaynell is a tomboy.  it seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa.  her parents are just plain crazy.  mama repedily whipped racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to ""tear up"" their hides each time they do something he does not like.  once jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar, nearly strangleing her, and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize. then jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on racie.  her parents are just crazy.  then grandpa dies.  dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it.  i understand that sparking fear in a child's eye is a good thing.  children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy.  racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs.  jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful.  these people were crazy.  this book is crazy. ugh!"	0
this book is my masters thesis. i built a multi layered combative system driven wholly by neural networks evolved using genetic algorithms. the learning of agents was unsupervised and they existed collaboratively and adversarily. if all of this made no sense, dont worry! read this book and it will.  the book covers these techniques (except for multi layered architectures) to a level understood by anyone with a basic knowledge of c++. it totally demystifies nns and gas. other books on these subjects actually put you off the entire concepts of ai by feeding you fear and confusion.  i have completed the book and have read it numerous times. it is going to be invaluable for my development of phd stuff - his writing introduces areas for potential research.  im would definately buy other books from this author. i hope he covers other areas of ai soon and puts 'em into print.  be jaysus, tis mighty i tell ya!!. buckland de-jargonises the field of ai	1
"as you would expect from oxford, this is a very well done edition of the play, with a comprehensive introduction (though i wished for a little more theatre history myself) that covers the major issues in this ""problem"" comedy (though it is not nearly so much a problem play as, say, troilus and cressida, in fact being much closer in many ways to measure for measure), several textual appendices, an index, useful textual- and foot-notes (there seem to be a great many phrasings in this play that need explanation--a result of revision?), and two of shakespeare's direct sources in erasmus and painter.  there were a few points when i disagreed with the interpreations offered in the footnotes, but overall, the apparatus is excellent.    as for the play itself, the main action concerns the efforts of helen to recapture her husband bertram, who is given to her by the king as a reward for curing his fistula.  he does not think she, as a physician's daughter, is worthy of his station and flees to the wars in italy without consumating the marriage.  the comic subplot involves the exposure of the cowardice of his companion, paroles.  helen evnetually fulfills the requirements bertram sets out in a letter--to obtain his ring and bear a child by him--through a bed trick, and the play ends where it began, with the king (echoes of lear?) offering diana, who helped in the trick, her choice of husband.     overall, a very good edition of a less popular play. very good edition"	2

some things are best left as they were. the first edition was simple to read, and did not seem to be trying to be the most complete guide to cruising ever written. unfortunately i loaned my copy to a friend and it never came back so i ordered a new copy and got this one. i think the author has tried to write about too many subjects and include too many different ideas- it comes off  like a compendium of conflicting ideas. also this book more than the previous edition shows the author has a pretty big budget. not the best guide for those of us with more limited funds. i liked the first edition better	2
i picked up this book to find out a bit more about this branch of christianity, and by and large i was not disappointed. this is an eminently readable introduction to anglicanism, from its founding in the 16th century to the present day. it covers all the major developments, and gives a brief background for each. it is particularly useful for anyone who wishes to put the present controversies shaking the anglican communion in a historical context, and the last chapter of the book is devoted to these controversies.     the only shortcoming of the book is its overly historical and political point of view. i would have appreciated a more extensive insight into the anglican theology. overall, however, this is a wonderful little book and i highly recommend it. a very readable introduction	1
i see that some people were helped by this book.  i would not recommend this book for someone who has not experienced sex.  the advice to virgins was disgusting.  the writers say that the sexual act is not natural and that people need help enjoying it.  the writer also suggests techniques of preparation for the virgin the month before that most assuredly would either lead to depending on yourself for fulfillment or it would train a young lady to not be responsive.  i thought the book was sick.  it turns women into an object of function. it also talks about men being 100% head of the household and women being 100% submissive.  the authors are a husband and wife but i can't hear a woman's voice anywhere in this book.  the cover is pretty so she probably had something to do with that. i'm sure she submitted completely to him in the writing of this book and that is why it is completely clinical and even crude. natural vs unnatural	0
"the late richard laymon's book ""to wake the dead"" is about a mummy who comes to life to terrorize the los angeles community that is housing the egyptian exibit.  also there is a strong side story about people being kidnapped and held as sex slaves somewhere.  that is actually the creepier story.  but the mummy one is really a dandy too.  the mummy story is not my favorite horror theme (and i did not like the stephen sommers/brenden frasier movies, either), but then it had never been presented like this.  actually a lot of it was very h.p. lovecraft influenced; mentioning of the evil ancient snake god set, the museum is named after charles ward, starting to see the resemeblence?  the characters were less than i expected.  after reading ""in the dark"" i thought he would have some richly developed characters; but i guess there were just too many to juggle to give them all proper time to mature.  there were the kidnap victims, the blind woman, the runaway teenagers, the hedonist egyptian, the museum curator and her boyfriend; i guess too many subplots and not really tied up effeciently.  but this is still a great book, and i think any fan of horror will enjoy it. amara awakenes"	2
from woolf to dickens and carlyle to a wonderful essay on little black sambo's author to josephine baker, phylis rose's objects of consideration have always been profoundly significant. we used to read her books because  they told us about the world. but now we learn only about phyllis rose's  world, and it isn't the least bit appealing, or interesting or even  revelatory. rose has lost her way completely. her early books expressed a  kind of insight, albeit in a perpetually arrogant and smug tone, that is  completely absent from this book. an author in search of a subject. perhaps  this is her last book. shallow, lazy and narcissistic memoir	0

"here is a book to hold to your heart, it is that good. and before i even get to the fun, lively and irresistible plot, let me just say that we know on page one that miss lavinia, our own low country auntie mame, has passed away. and yet at the end, when we have finished getting to know her and attend her death and funeral, i was crying like a baby. and i don't cry at books!!    the plot to this book is true to dotty frank's genre: displaced low country gal comes home, gets mesmerized, and slowly regains her roots. in this case, the woman is caroline wimbley levine, married to a cold and smug psychiatrist, richard, and living in equally cold luxury in new york with their beloved son eric.    when caroline hears from her brother trip that their mother, lavinia, is losing her marbles and must be put in assisted living, caroline grabs eric and goes home for what she thinks will be for a few days. and there she is caught up in the gullah magic; the low country mystique (in which i thoroughly believe, thanks to dotty's wonderful books) and a chance to become, once again, the ""real"" caroline.    this might be the best of the four books dotty frank has so-far written. i cannot praise it highly enough. grab it and lose yourself in a truly wonderful read. auntie mame, low country style"	1
i purchased this for my 11 year old son.  i am so thankful that i read this book before giving it to him or going straight to discussing it.  the pictures are hand drawn but graphic.  far too much detail for the target audience. kids need to know about sexuality but they don't need to know everything before they are even teen-agers.  i would be upset to find this in a school library.  this book definitely needs to be used with supervision. i returned this book as i believe its content is inappropriate for the cover advertised age of 10 years old. not age appropriate.  shocking.	0
having been sent this book as a present by a friend in the us, i felt i must tell others just what a treasure trove it is. it has been written by  someone who not only obviously loves his subject, but who has written a  clear, easy-to-read amd well-illustrated guide for those of us who have  developed an interest in early american furniture but who lacked expertise.  it also tells you how to care for furniture. i can't recommend it highly  enough. if you are interested in early american furniture, read this	1
i have read most of kosinski's works of fiction, and i must say that this is one of my favorites.  it is more along the lines of steps or the cockpit, but it is a little more experimental in its story telling.  there  are different narrators, both first and third person, who tell the story of  a very wealthy young man's journey through life.  like the characters in  steps and the cockpit, waylen is very self absorbed and often performs  horrifying acts of revenge on those who get in his way.  i would recommend  this book to anyone. an amazing book - one of kosinski's best	1

"the feeling the book gave me was one of disjointed-ness, i couldn't  fully submerge myself into the book because it didn't seem like the writer could decide how she wanted to present the material. it read like conjecture for a lot of it, with ""could"", ""would have"" , and it also read like a lecture given by a professor, at the same time, it was too conversational, and in all just poorly written. the material was interesting enough, and her conjectures intriguing, it was just the presentation that was faulty. it would also have been better if she could have given logic for her conjectures, as it is...she would have done better to have written the book as a fiction novel, and it would have carried better. poorly written...interesting material rendered boring"	0
"sundown towns goes a long way towards explaining the us' pervasive racial problems by examining a phenomenon many white people had thought dead and gone: sundown towns (cities or neighborhoods where racial minorities were not allowed to live or even be present after dark).      it would be tempting to dismiss loewen's research as merely anecdotal, but obviously more concrete evidence can rarely be found: even the most racist townships took care to mask their anti-black and minority rules through sleight of hand and legal double speak, and city limit signs that used to warn minorities not to linger after dark have now mostly vanished, but there is simply too much material here to ignore.  and the honest reader will have to admit that much of what loewen writes about sounds familiar.  we've all heard excuses for why blacks and whites tend to live separately: the blacks like it that way, they don't care about good schools and nice houses, etc, etc.  we've also heard plenty of ""blame the victim"" stories indicating that it is black laziness and racial inferiority that prevents them from moving to the suburbs.  and we've all heard other whites making disparaging comments about minorities and not protested, thus becoming tacitly complicit.    reading some of loewen's stories about the race riots and lynchings that helped create the sundown towns, reminded me of some of the histories of the nazi rise to power in germany during the 1920s and 1930s. so many of the methods for dealing with despised groups, whether whites against blacks or nazis against jews, are terrifyingly similar: economic boycotts, terror bombings, sabotage, etc.  and the language used by so called ""white patriots"" warning of the threat posed by black migration to an area reminded me of nothing so much as the screams of osama bin laden and his followers for the annihilation of the west to defend islam. (yet another reminder that we humans are all indeed ""brothers under the skin!"")      i already knew i lived near one of the more infamous sundown counties, but as i read this book i began to suspect that some other communities and neighborhoods i'm familiar with may be sundown as well, and that's something i intend to investigate for myself.    as a southerner with long ancestral roots in the former slave owning regions, i have always been aware of the dark history of race relations there.  it was with some surprise (and i hope a forgiveable amount of satisfaction at seeing such hypocrisy revealed at long last) that i read that sundown towns were and are far more pervasive in the north and west, and that the southern states, far from being exceptions to a rule of general tolerance, were merely the most prominent examples of nationwide intolerance.      loewen provides some excellent reasons for why sundown towns are bad for their residents as well as the people they keep out:  the cultural aridity, the fostering of racial stereotyping, the unwillingness to try new ideas or customs. and he ably restates what the supreme court said in the brown decision back in 1954: segregation has a degrading, scarring emotional and physical toll that makes it completely unacceptable.      lowewen suggests some interesting methods for confronting and hopefully putting an end to the sundown phenomenon, including a call for a residents' rights act that i fear will take a seismic shift in national politics to ever have a chance of becoming law. (to start with we'd need a president and vice-president who don't live in sundown towns themselves!) more realistic suggestions emphasize action by concerned volunteers willing to research and ask the difficult questions needed to shock the many out of their complacency.    this isn't a comfortable book to read, but it may come to be considered as important as gunnar myrdal's an american dilemma in helping americans deal with the quandaries of creating a truly equal multi-racial society. painful but essential reading"	1

in her autobiographical novel, i know why the caged bird sings, maya angelou recounts her life story as a young, keenly intelligent but insecure black girl in the south during the 1930s and california during the 1940s. the book conveys the difficulties associated with the mixture of racial and gender discrimination endured by a southern black girl, though, and this is perhaps the most fundamental theme explored in her autobiography. the intersectionality of race and gender is a pivotal thread of angelou's theme, where more than one type of subjugation results in a multiple burden for the victim. overall, i know why the caged bird sings is a powerful, stirring account of the intersectionality of race and gender regarding black women. though segregation had been officially declared null and void, many of the southern states were steeped in racist tendencies that further multiplied the gender inequality that exposed black women to a multi-faceted oppression. peiss, hine, terborg-penn, bederman, et. al. all examine threads of this intersectionality, and in discussing these threads, one can draw a distinct comparison between anti-black, anti-black women sentiment and angelou's personal experiences. as a girl, angelou believed her gender to be a limiting factor. she considered herself to be unheroic, and incapable of achieving spectacular feats like the boys in her comic books. in the narrative, being female for angelou is just as trying as being black, and she struggled with the double burden, rather than embracing it. however, as more and more black women slowly overcame their troubles as a result of the overwhelming intersectionality of the time, so did angelou. the novel ended with hope because she bucks the stereotype to become the first black female streetcar conductor. angelou's spike in confidence and belief in her ability reflects the gradual evolution of black women's race and gender after decades of imprisonment, and foreshadows a future of activism, struggle for respect and eventual victory in those regards. intersectionality as described by maya angelou	2

"in a time when reformed theology is on the rise, pinnock and his co-authors seek to provide an arminian understanding of scripture.  however, the book is strewn with problems.  the authors claim that god's love trumps other attributes like holiness and justice, but they give no scriptural support.  their arguments are based simply on our western sense of fairness.  they make such appeals because they believe our moral sense reflects truth, instead of recognizing our fallen nature.  in addition, they advocate ""making peace with the culture of modernity"" (27).  instead of letting god's word shape our thinking, they allow our lost culture to shape our view of god's word.      the result is a presentation of a weak, helpless god.  in fact, the authors state ""it is more important for god to give himself to his creation than to rule the world or to be worshipped"" (35).  he is described not as ruling, but as ""limited by humanity"" (40) , vulnerable, and ""the defenseless superior power"" (175).  the book has weak, humanistic argumentation, little scriptural support, and a harsh tone toward those who embrace reformed views, views said to be ""theologically repugnant"" (84).  do not waste your time with this book.  while there are legitimate differences between arminian and calvinistic views and a place for dialogue, this book does not give dialogue but instead gives unsubstantiated claims that leave you with a helpless god not in control and not worthy of worship.      in case you do not know, the editor of this book embraces the view that god does not know the future. presents god as weak, vulnerable, and limited"	0

"for those of you who saw ""shakespeare in love,"" you will probably remember john webster as the 13 year old boy who was obsessed with blood and death. john webster's plays came out about the time william shakespeare was putting out his final plays. hazelton spencer says this of john webster: ""even webster's most lyrical verse is preoccupied with decay and death."" but if we are willing to move past this, john webster's writing is actually quite impressive. act 1 begins with the banishment of count lodovico. interestingly, lodovico tells of the evil bracciano. (why not? it would seem people of an evil nature would know each other.) and through the testimony of his judges, we are introduced to the evil behind lodovico. we later meet the diabolical bracciano himself. he is having an affair with his friend flamineo's sister vittoria. not surprisingly, vittoria has a nightmare about a massacre. we later see that cornelia (the mother of vittoria and flamineo) does not care for them. in act 2, we meet the cardinal. we are allowed to respect him in that he is no flatterer. webster then shows us the division between the diabolical bracciano and the at least moderately virtuous francisco. (francisco is of course angered that his sister isabella is being mistreated by her husband bracciano.) but bracciano's untainted son giovanni breaks the tension with some comic relief. with the use of magical images, bracciano sees his murder plot against his wife isabella and vittoria's husband camillo come to pass. but lodovico sees the death of isabella, and he will return before long. onto act 3. the cardinal suspects that vittoria had something to do with her husband's death. we know that it was not vittoria's fault, but how sorry can we feel for her? if she was this intimate with the diabolical bracciano, how ignorant could she have been (unless she was very obtuse) to the evil she submitted herself to? the cardinal sentences vittoria to life as a nun. during the trial, flamineo is frightened that his part in aiding the affair will come out. and lodovico makes his return. he loved isabella (even though she would not submit to having an affair with him), and lodovico will avenge her. (perhaps webster was trying to use contrast between isabella and vittoria to limit our sympathy to vittoria.) onto act 4. the cardinal informs francisco of his sister's murder. francisco of course wants revenge. while we have no real reason to dislike the cardinal or see him as a bad person, it is interesting that the cardinal has a book of criminals. can we doubt for a moment that lodovico is listed in it? (but like shakespeare and dickens, webster is really skilled at creating fully 3d characters as opposed to hollywood heroes and villains.) isabella's ghost appears to francisco. (probably to make sure francisco will not hesitate in his revenge.) bracciano and vittoria meet again, and while vittoria is reluctant, she and bracciano marry. act 4 ends with the cardinal becoming pope. after rebuking lodovico, the cardinal approves of him joining in fracisco's revenge. perhaps here, webster is pointing out a 'terrible truth' that hollywood can't figure out. as people, we are not 100 % good or evil. and while the cardinal is a virtuous person, he agrees to the revenge on bracciano even to the point of employing the evil lodovico. and while we know lodovico is evil, we probably will applaud him if he contributes to bracciano's comeuppance. onto act 5. bracciano and vittoria marry. disuised, francisco finds his way into bracciano's territory. well, fracisco and lodovico succeed in killing bracciano. but things are not quite over. giovanni is sad over his father's death. vittoria (bracciano's widow) is in charge for the moment. and flamineo thinks he can get some money out of his sister. (why not? he aided her in her affair. vittoria probably has access to money now.) bracciano's ghost appears to flamineo foreshadowing his downfall. interestingly, in john webster, ghosts appear to the people who were close to them as opposed to their enemies. the play ends in the massacre of zanche, flamineo, and vittoria by lodovico. (undoubtedly, francisco and lodovico wanted them dead as well to avenge isabella.) giovanni to some extent restores orders and lodovico tells giovanni that francisco was involved. lodovico can be punished, but what can giovanni do to his uncle francisco? francisco is also a duke. overall, its a good play, but you do have to have a tolerance for brutal scenes as well as passages preoccupied with death. the edgar alan poe of shakespeare's  day.

this book, like mccreight's other books on working metals, divides the subject into easily digestible portions and treats each topic separately (often on a separate page) with a short discussion. line drawings help clarify important points. the focus is on the tools, materials, and techniques of lost wax casting, but also covers sand casting, the use of flexible molds, using the services of a foundry, and other topics of concern to the studio metalsmith. it's a great reference tool if you need to look up the proper sequence to use in a particular technique, or a formula for making your own crucibles. learning to cast almost requires hands-on instruction, and this book alone cannot provide that. but if you're already familiar with casting, it's a wonderful reference. excellent summary of studio casting techniques	1

it is a crime that the founders of america are dismissed because they are represented as failing to meet our present pc standards of faux morality.  this terrific book takes on every pc misconception about them and sets the record straight.  while never presenting them is marble pillars of morality, the author puts all of the issues in their proper context and demonstrates clearly the intelligence, morality, and rightness of our founders.      one of the most famous of the old canards that you will still hear is that the founders only considered slaves to be 3/5 of a human being because it says so right there in the constitution.  how sad that misunderstanding and misrepresentation is.  because each state was given a number of representatives based upon the number of residents, the issue was whom do you count.  you have to first ask yourself whom the representatives from the slave holding states would represent.  the slaves?  of course not!      so, if the rights of the slaves were not going to be protected, to give their slaveholders the ability to count those slaves as people and thereby become over-represented in congress would actually work against interests of those people trapped in slavery.  those opposing slavery wanted the slaves to remain uncounted for representation.  the slaveholders wanted them to count as a full person (does that mean the slaveholders cared about the human rights of the slaves more than the abolitionists?).  the compromise was to count them as 3/5.  however, it is essential to remember that those who wanted the slaves counted as a whole person were uninterested in the rights of those human beings and those that wanted them uncounted actually had the interests of the slaves more in mind.    professor west also takes on the issues of property rights, who had the right to vote and why, women and their rights at the time of the revolution, poverty, and immigration.    a good and informative read.  every student should read it as an antidote to the misinformation they get during their indoctrination at the public schools.  this book will actually aid their education and help them develop a solid understanding of what is really at stake in our country.  and it might spark some lively debate when they go to class armed with some information the teacher will likely find inconvenient or even bewildering.  one of my daughters actually had to go to the blackboard and explain the 3/5 issue carefully to the teacher and class.  the teacher commented that she had never thought of it that way before.  which, of course, means, that she had always taught it as a political tenet rather than history. cleansing the mental palate of political correctness	2

"i'm not sure who wrote the positive reviews here, but i can tell you as a student using this book that it is among the worst i've ever been stuck with and most of my classmates seem to agree.    the concepts are made much more difficult than they should be by poor writing.  the authors jump around constantly, use new terminology at times before introducing it, and provide examples that are inadequate in helping to solve the problems at the end of the chapter.  stylistically, the writing is very bland and sure to put you to sleep.  the first sentence of the book is ""this is a book about signals and systems.""    sure, this book may cover all of the core concepts involved in signal processing, but trying to make sense of it when you don't already have a background in the subject is quite a challenge.  after reading the chapters, we were unable to solve most of the problems in the book until given the answers were given to us.  i've dealt with bad textbooks before, but this one tops them all.  needless to say, it was very frustrating experience and i can't say i recommend this book. needs improvement"	0

i was impressed by this clear and concise guide. as an undergrad, i took a legal writing class. we had no textbook, but we could have used this one. now, i'm in law school, where i found this book on my own. half the work is trying to figure out what legal types are saying. judges and lawyers could make my job easier by reading this book. as a student, i find it a good resource to help avoiding such pitfalls. clear and concise	1

having skimmed the reviews on this site it is apparent i am not the only person who decided the world according to garp was worth re-reading after 25 years.      the world according to garp is ultimately about lust and its destructive nature.  if you are easily offended (irving's novels tend to revolve around twisted sexual behaviour and garp is no exception) you may want to avoid the world according to garp (and pretty much everything in the irving catalogue).      but the world according to garp is more than a series of bizarre sexual encounters.  it is a complex, disturbing, and insightful novel. in the world according to garp, irving has created some of the most vivid, unique, and truly memorable characters in modern literature, not to mention some of the best lines of dialogue ever put to paper.  the world according to garp is both hilarious and heartbreakingly poignant.     i do have to admit that i did find (as i often find with irving's novels) that it meanders a little in the middle (i could have done with a little less on the wife-swapping relationship for example).  even though some plot lines didn't engage me as thoroughly as others, all in all, the world according to garp is a well written, enormously entertaining novel.    if you haven't read anything by john irving, the world according to garp is a great place to start.  if you read the novel years ago, its well worth reading again. hilarious and heartbreaking	2
this novel could not hold my interest.  i am an anne perry fan, but could not get into this book.  i couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting.   i'm really disappointed, because i was looking forward to a new series by her.  joseph and matthew lost their parents to murder and joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion.  maybe ms. perry tried to tell too many stories within one story.  in reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why i didn't like this book. i would skip this series and read the pitt series. couldn't hold my interest	2
a little wordy and sometimes hard to find the main idea in each chapter. there is quite a bit of info in in the book. lots of information but wordy	2
i would refer anyone who would take this author seriously to james randi's comments on his behavior. he represents the modern version of the crystal ball reader and his claims should be eyed with an appropriate degree of skepticism. this would be a benign phenomenon but that his success depends on the suspension of reasoned thought on the part of those who grieve for their lost loved ones. question everything	0
i never took a psychology course in my life, but one day, for some reason or another, i decided to take the ap psychology exam. i picked up this book, read it throughly and took the tests at the back. on test day, i was literally laughing because the test was exactly the material presented in the barron's book. i breezed through effortlessly and got a 5. i would like to extend my sincere thanks to the makers of this book- i cannot tell you my appreciation, and i applaud your production of an outstanding review book. if you truly know every concept in this book, i cannot, in anyway, foresee a score less than a 5.     by the way, the tests at the back of the book are slightly more complicated than the real thing, so don't be alarmed if you miss 10 or 15...keep in mind i was laughing on test day.     thank you barron'. i have never encountered a more perfect review book	1
great expectations was perhaps one of the worst book ever written. i'm no dickens' expert, but i do know a little about literature- i don't know how this even passed through the editing stage. it is slow-paced, boring, pointless, and an all-out waste of time to read. i have read challenging books with strong points like this before, and have sometimes enjoyed them,  but never have i read a book this pointless and difficult to read, with such a stupid ending.  dont waste your money and valuable time on it!!!!!!. entirely awful book	0
this is the first molly blume mystery i've read, and i really enjoyed it -- enough that i will probably go back and read the earlier ones, to find out how molly got to where she is.  as an orthodox jew, i'm impressed with the accuracy and understatement of ms. krich's depiction of modern orthodox jews -- it's so accurate, without painting the lifestyle as the source of all ills or the source of all happiness as a lot of other writers try to do.    i'm also looking forward to the next book.  there are some hints in this one of molly's possible infertility, and i really hope the author delves into that -- having her deal with fertility issues and treatments rather than just providing a miraculous baby.  it's such an important topic, especially within the orthodox world.  i would love to see how molly deals with it. very interesting mystery	1

this was a medieval project in my 7th grade humanities class    the summary: catherine called birdy was a conflict type book. it was mostly about her pig head of a father trying to sell her to the richest man. if you like the way it sounds now you should look for a copy. it is quite interesting and has a lot of conflict in the book.  a phew funny things were when catherine caught some objects on fire!  rating: i rated my book 2  stars because it was kind of boring. why is because all the book was really about was catherine's father trying to sell off to the richest man. when i did like it was when she tried to get out of each man.  who this book would be suited for:  i would recommend this book to someone who really likes conflict books in the medieval times. also is if you are interested in action books. the fantastic review of the journal	2
wowsers.  this book is chock full of information--cultural, biological, historical, literary--pertaining to the human body.  sims has done a masterful job of research; this book springs to life with allegories, allusions and myths, each connected to a particular part of the body.  though not as humorous as mary roach's marvelous paean to the cadaver, _stiff_, this book proves to be just as interesting.  if your interest is piqued by the body human, you must read this book.  sims goes much further than what you would find on nova--for instance, he addresses the purpose of eyebrows and why bram stoker's dracula presents the true embodiment of evil.  you'll sail through this book; although it can be a bit viscous, with perseverance, the reader will learn myriad factoids.  it is well written, thoroughly researched and will refocus the reader on the miracle that is the human form. a cultural cornucopia!!	2
i've been looking for a book just like this one for years. it has a wide list of movies from westerns to romantic, from la to toledo, from great to dreadful. the detail of the information is very complete and, most important, concise. i think is the best travel guide ever. a real treasure. a wide compilation	1
with a 1998 copyright, one might expect this manual to be a bit outdated.   it's unfortunate, because otherwise, it's an excellent reference at a very inexpensive price.   the section on electronic sources doesn't adequately deal with the proliferation of electronic databases, websites, and other new media.   you'd be better off using one of the many free online mla formatting pages available on university websites. outdated style sheet...doesn't address web sources	2
being an avid admirer of manet and of the paintings in which victorine meurent appeared, i was happy to see a book about her.  finally, i would be able to learn something of her and her life!  i learned that she was a lesbian and died in 1927 and not as a destitute alcoholic as written in some rather sketchy histories of her. but that is all i learned.  the book is actually more about the author and her trying to make peace with her past and her mother than anything else.  if you want to learn about victorine, you must find another book.  if you want to know about eunice lipton, this is the book for you.  also very few facts in the book; the author puts victorine in some situations and conversations, but these are all imaginary.  definitely would not recommend.  author was self-indulgent and apparently not very concerned with her subject. very disappointing	2
was disappointed in the ideas.  seemed to be more of an extension of the author's collections, than ideas for the reader. scanned the book it and put it on the shelf, won't be one that i use as a constant reference. yuk!	0
i've been surprised and enriched through reading mercury retrograde.  the writing is both interesting and informative, and ms. peay's prose are beautiful.  i purchased the book shortly before the start of mercury retrograde, and was amazed how frequently i had experiences that the author asserts are typical during this period.  not only does ms. peay offer suggestions and advice for living during mr, but her observations can be carried through the rest of the year!. a guide for mercury retrograde, a handbook for life.	1

"a very successful introduction to picasso's work and life! whether you just want to admire his paintings or try to learn from him, this book is a good choice. some people don't understand picasso and are insulted by astronomic prices of his ""childish"" looking paintings. in this book ingo f. walther sheds light on the phenomenon of this genius by presenting all the phases of painter's development that naturally resulted in the spontaneous expressions of his imagery. or with the artist's words: ""when i was as old as these children, i could draw like raphael. but it took me a lifetime to learn to draw like them!"" thus we can follow picasso from his youth, blue and rose periods to his invention of cubism and all the way to his late works. in addition there are chapters on his sculptures, posters and ceramics.     the book also gives a rich selection of interesting aspects of picasso's life. an enormous publicity was haunting him as well as helping him test his brave inventions. whatever he touched turned to gold. when he finally grew tired of publicity and decided to move from paris to a provincial village of ménerbes, he was given a chalet in exchange for a still life. introducing the genius"	1
waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages. ha jin's personal accomplishments notwithstanding, this is one of the most overrated books i have read. national book award? hmmm.     waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution, lin, trapped in a loveless marriage. when lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital--manna wu--herself the victim of waiting for a man, he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands. everyone in waiting waits...and waits...and waits.    the book gets its point across, and more or less works as an allegory on the chinese communist state. it lacks any deeply interesting characterization, as manna, and even lin, are both all too childlike (as the author intends). the book also lacks lyricism and elegance, and unforgivable trangression for sucha  decorated piece of literature. ha jin's story educates, but doesn't elevate us. waiting...point taken	2

"as far as i know, iris johansen has only written a few books in the mystery genre but numerous of the romance variety (ok, so they may have been hot and steamy, but the mysteries have much better story lines!). in my opinion, all of these mystery tomes are fantastic and i highly recommend each and every one of them! if i had to pick a favorite one, i'd be hard pressed, as each are unique and utterly captivating. i finished long after midnight and loved it! was it better than ugly duckling or face of deception or the killing game or and then you die? i can't make that decision but i can tell you that each one of these kept me intrigued until the very end.    in long after midnight, kate denby a doctor of genetic research is an unwilling target for competitors who are willing to kill in order to stop the completion of a drug that will change the world. noah smith, of j and s pharmaceuticals, approached kate to go to work for him and refuses to take no for an answer. the opposition doesn't know or care that she's turned him down. when her ex-husband is killed in a car bombing right in front of her, not so soon after noah's plant is blasted, she begins to suspect that something is wrong. this begins the story of her run in order to save not only her life, but also that of her young son, joshua. iris johansen throws in a few love entanglements with kate, noah and seth, noah's best friend. seth has the responsibility of helping to keep them safe while noah and kate try to finish work on ru2, the wonder drug of the future. this is enough to make a wonderful story, but johansen doesn't stop there. she throws into the mix a diabolical creature named ishmaru who enjoys scalping his victims. kate defeats ishmaru once, but he's on her trail and uses joshua's safety to play head games with kate.     when things seemed to level out to a steady rhythm, johansen hurled an obstacle to create another dimension - a realm i hadn't even thought existed. i don't think you'll ever really figure out the entire plot and subplots included in this book until the very end. i thought i had everything worked out in my head and then bam - a major zigzag was added that gave even more depth to the tale.    iris johansen has a unique style and you will always be thrown off by an unexpected twist in the book (usually towards the end of it). this is what makes her mysteries more enticing than most writers - she's always trying to keep the reader on his/her toes.     this is definitely a ""stop light book"" and you'll lose sleep trying to finish this one! an absolute must for your summer reading list! by the way, if you haven't read my definition of a stop light book, it's in my review of ugly duckling by this same author. mystery better than sex?"	1
this is an excellent book for actually trying to understand this difficult subject. firstly its not bogged down with obsolete american units, though it does cover enough examples for anyone who really wants to go that way. secondly there is a wealth of tables and properties in the index, which alone makes this book worth the money as a reference tool,(and all in simple si units).third, there seems to have been a determined effort at getting the message across. the one shortcoming i have found is the lack of a list of symbols/abbreviations used throughout the book (hence the lack of the fifth star rating), though they thankfully are pretty standard. my tip - if you read this very worthwhile book, jot down the symbols as they crop up then you won't waste any time having to track them down again. these comments do not apply to the identical version that comes with a software supplement (i tried it but couldnt be bothered to get up to speed with the mathcad its written with). excellent	2
"this is a worthy and ambitious debut novel about the barbadian immigrant experience  in brooklyn, new york, by a little known african-american author, whose own parents emigrated from barbados during world war i. the author herself grew up in brooklyn. she attended brooklyn college, graduating phi beta kappa in 1953, a time when most americans, much less a black woman, did not attend college. this drive to succeed is a testament to her barbadian heritage.    it is from that heritage that the author drew in creating her characters and developing their rich mix of personalities, as she re-created the early  barbadian immigrant experience in post-depression era brooklyn. the book focuses on the boyces, a nuclear family consisting of silla, the ambitious, hard working, ever striving mother, deighton,  her charming, pie-in-the-sky dreamer of a husband, and their two daughters, ina, the older and more passive one, and selina, the bright, rebellious one. the novel follows the fortunes of the boyce family from the late 1930s until shortly after word war ii. it tells of their lives, their hopes, and their dreams.     the book beautifully details the experience of the early barbadian immigrants in brooklyn and their adjustment to their new environment. they brought with them their own ideas, their own ways of doing things, and a work ethic that is hard to beat. quite frankly, barbadians revitalized areas of brooklyn that were dormant. theirs was an almost traditional immigrant experience, but for the racism that they were to encounter here. still, they did not allow that to stand in their way from getting ahead and going for the american dream.     this book neatly encapsulates that immigrant experience through the boyce family. one gets a very good sense of what the experience of the barbadian immigrant was like through the interactions of the boyce family with others in their community, as well as with each other. while silla boyce typifies the barbadian community in terms of goals and work ethic, dreams and desires, with its focus upon material acquisition, her husband, deighton, does not.  their separate dreams and desires conflict and act as a catalyst for a tragedy that would mar intra-familial relationships.     it is also a coming of age story, as selina struggles to find her place in the new society and rich community her people are creating. she also struggles to find her place in the larger community, as well, stepping out of the insular one into one where racism is a factor. she is also interested in exploring her roots and heritage. still, being who she is, the reader believes that selina will not founder. though selina would hate to admit it, she is the one who is most like her mother, a fact of which she is not cognizant throughout most of the novel. she is truly her mother's daughter, in thought and deed.    this is a richly satisfying novel. the author captures the ""bajun"" way of speaking in all its rich, expressive cadence. while some may find this ""bajun"" dialect, which is interspersed throughout the novel, difficult to follow or distracting, it is this richness of language that give this book its very distinctive feel. moreover, while the author may sometimes get too bogged down with overly descriptive detail, she paints a vibrant picture of a segment of society that has too long been ignored in literature.  those who like reading about the immigrant experience will enjoy this book, as will those who are interested in discovering worthy authors that have receded from public memory. the barbadian immigrant experience in brooklyn, ny..."	2
the book contains the complete works of arthur rimbaud in chronological order, in both english and french. there is an excellent short introduction to rimbaud, along with a very nice explanation of the translation process, and the difficulties inherent in translating poetry.    sadly, the translations presented in this volume do a grave injustice to rimbaud. in his efforts to render an accurate contemporary translation, mason removes nearly every vestige of poetic rhythm and rhyme from his poems. even though my french is inadequate to enjoy rimbaud in his original language, i found myself turning frequently to the french versions of the poems, as i tried to understand how a poet of rimbaud's reputation could possibly write so poorly. in poem after poem, the french version was more readable than mason's translation even though i could only understand about a third of what i read.    i ended up exchanging the book for a version translated by paul schmidt, which was much more readable. ironically, mason offers criticism of schmidt's translation in his book.    while this book might be a worthwhile addition to the library of someone already familiar with rimbaud, i would recommend that any person seeking an introduction to his poetry look elsewhere for a translation. excellent content - unpleasant translation	2

this is an essential book for hep c.  i have used the herbal protocol for 8 months and brought my viral load down to 69,000 and it is still dropping.  before i read this book, i had almost convinced myself that traditional treatment was the only way, even with its horrible side effects.  now, i am so glad that i found this book, contacted dry creek herb farm (referenced in the book) and started my daily herb treatments.  the only side effect of the herb is that they don't taste very good, but with the results i have had they are starting to taste pretty good.  the cost is very affordable also.  thank you stephen harrod buhrner and dry creek herb farm. herbs for hepatitis c and the liver	1

i came to this book with great anticipation. i had read its a modern american classic, a gem that is full of meaning. i thought i was in for a treat.     i worked my way through it, and wondered where, in god's name, it was going, and why i bothered reading it.     its a huge bore, a monumental waste of time. binx is about as dull as anyone can be, and none of the other characters are interesting. the reader goes from one boring situation to another.     percy was trying to write about despair, and in that he was a success. the reader feels terrible despair each time another page is turned. the end of this dreadful novel cannot come quickly enough.     i realize i might well be missing what others admire. my loss, i am sure. the book failed to move me.     its  not for everyone. i do not wish to disparage those who like it. many regard it as great. i do not. what a dreadful book	0
"i found this book to be weird quiet frankly. chapter 2 goes off the deep-end of designing efficient queries before you've even built a report yet. that material should have been put at the end of the book. creating a report with the report wizard is covered in chapter 4 but probably would have been best if it was before chapter 3 which covers creating a report manually. i didn't find anything ""pro"", as the name implies, or advanced with the book. it's a broad introductory text only. also, it only covers using the reportviewer control for win forms and not the one web forms. the two are similar enough but coverage of both would have been better. you should probably look elsewhere"	2

i tried to like this book, but by page 61, i had to put it down. the main charachter, helen, is a self-absorbed tramp and an unfit mother. she kisses people on a whim. she flirts and sleeps with anyone in town. she talks about how much she misses her daughter, who is away at camp, but i don't believe that she thinks of anyone by herself. she drops the f-bomb casually, as if that were speech becoming of a lady...which she is not. the plot is absurd. that she could be as callous and crude as she is represented to be and as popular as she is also purported to be, is impossible. this character is lewd, obstinant, selfish, childish, and impetuous. do not pick this book up unless you admire loose women who are horrible mothers. disgusting, and not a very funny book, either. horrible	0
"i found the plot of this book impossible to follow.  it contains excessively verbose descriptions with a lot of cliches. the hero almost dies twice in a row and is each time magically saved for no reason.  and there are only so many times i can read variations of ""he swung his sword really hard"" and ""it was a really scary dragon.""  the illustrations are quite beatiful, though. it must be a guy thing"	2
"the one major strength of this book, from a computer science viewpoint, is its emphasis on ""attack patterns"".  this systemization of these issues really differentiates this book from many of its competitors (which tend to be either the latest 500 hacks or descriptions of standards).  put simply cs is the study of algorithms, and this book fits nicely into that tradition. why we use it for a graduate class"	2
"my real rating is 1.5 stars. the book won't put you to sleep, but it's not going to teach you anything you won't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years.  readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport: though the closest i've ever gotten to golf in my 47 years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood, i learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent.  feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context: what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity. hence, for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time, the book will be useless.  bad points: besides that mentioned, the prose is (as mentioned in my title) in large measure cliches and reads, as other reviewers have pointed out, like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure. for newspaper articles, such is no great handicap, but for a book is makes for tediousness. next is a quibble, perhaps, but in the trade paperback edition i picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book. the book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper.  if you're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none (as i was when i selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion), ""a good walk spoiled"" will suffice. if you're looking for a good book, look elsewhere. 40% cliches"	2
the way idle in his book badly treats anyone who saw his performance but didn't care for it shows how truly stuck up he is. everyone over 10 who watches his performances has to believe he's every bit as great as he thinks he is or he gets negative about it. the drawing of idle as a lady is thankfully missing from the new paperback version.     to the most recent reviewer here before me i say this. george harrison was part of the arguably biggest bunch of musicians in history (the beatles). there was a moment in the 1960's when almost every youngster in the us, england and australia  between 13 and 18 years of age was into the beatles. there was never a moment when the pythons had such a fan following. comparisons between beatles and pythons are ridiculous.  when idle's time comes the only people who'll blab about him in their own books would be the surviving pythons (even carol cleveland). the book shows a cult celebrity who is indeed overly full of himself	0

"""the best way i know to resuscitate the theatre is to produce dangerous new works,"" says stuart ostrow in his very slim (154 pages, double spaced with wide margins) new memoir of his producing career.  however he does not define ""dangerous new works.""  from reading the book, it seems his definition of ""dangerous new works"" is whatever is being touted by the village voice.  (richard foreman, homosexuality, multiculturalism, tom eyen, etc.)  stuart ostrow has a story, but he is looking at it from the wrong point of view.  the way he sees it, he was producing quality innovative stuff that the world conspired to make fail.  another way of looking at it would show a talented young producer who, after producing big hits with 1776 and pippin, went pretentious and politically correct with his subsequent shows and understandably failed.    his damnation of mel brooks is unjustified since ostrow himself says that he has not seen the producers.  well, stu, i have news for you.  the producers was a dangerous new work.  it was a slap in the face at political correctness and pretentiousness.  it single-handedly killed the bloated euro musical that had dominated broadway for twenty years and paved the way for outrageous, unpretentious shows like hairspray and the wedding singer.  the producers resuscitated the american musical and ostrow missed it.    ostrow also badmouths wicked claiming it was dependent upon special effects and spectacle.  if that were true, dance of the vampires would still be running.  the spectacle of wicked enhances its compelling story, unlike the all the additional sets and extra players gratuitously inserted into the boring la bete.     ostrow seems to think that problems can be solved by creating yet another bureaucracy to choose the artists who shall be anointed.  evidence has show that the bureaucratic method produces pretentious work like that of michael john lachiusa and jason robert brown, which the public doggedly refuses to embrace.    ostrow tells some good anecdotes, but i wish there had been more of them.  there's the germ of a fascinating book in this volume and in ostrow's previous memoir (also extremely brief and shares some material with this volume).  but at this point, there's still not a real book between the two of them. he's been hiding in houston too long"	2

beginning with her personal experiences and attraction to the world of the theater, swados bridges the gap of her own life with the common experiences of a group of youngsters as they create their own musical theater piece about the dangerous world they inhabit and the small redemptions of daily life as they accomplish their goals.  specifically structured, the exercises begin with personal experiences and expand to include the group as a whole, each phase furthering the creative community: direction, voice, movement, characters, improvisation, discussion, time, space, music and choreography, the conclusion, their own show.    this very accessible handbook is directed toward a specific audience, young people from twelve to the early twenties, ages mixed for maximum benefit from the experience. from middle and high school, young people can perform these exercises before their peers at public and private schools and local community centers, all directed toward channeling creative energy in a positive manner, the resulting performance a theatrical experience for the students involved. all of the categories outlined lend to the expansion of students' awareness, but a teacher/reader can improvise as necessary to accommodate his group for a performance outside of school, inside school, as a training ground for young actors in a dramatic school or community environment, even as exercises for a limited class time.    in the context of the theater, mentoring focuses on the sense of family created by mutual experience, a spirit of togetherness that may yield lifelong friendships and artistic collaborations. this hands-on guide to theatrical performance is practical and effective; if followed, it will enrich the lives of students who participate in the process. practical and specific, at play is a valuable teaching tool; even more, it is the diagram for success in a field that enhances students' life experiences and collaborative endeavors with their peers, the result empowering. luan gaines/2006. leaning the language of drama...	1
"although i agree with other reviewers who comment that the connection between this book and the smiths' album is as thin as smoke, i was prepared to enjoy a well-written story just the same.  unfortunately, i finished this wisp of a memoir wishing i had purchased the thirty-three and a third title about love's ""forever changes"" instead.  although i appreciated joe pernice's occasionally clever metaphors, these were too few and far between, leaving us instead with the musings of the book's exasperated protagonist, a teenage male infatuated with girls, alcohol, and new wave music.  of course, even as ordinary a topic as that can inspire brilliant and funny writing.  but it didn't here.  at least not for me, as i found pernice's protagonist niether interesting nor sympathetic.  worse, the book's exaggeration-as-a-primary-comedy-device (however accurate to the speech patterns of perhaps many, many average seventeen year-olds) is as unfunny as that dave barry essay.  (you know, the one he's recycled for the past decade and a half about how computers are complex and children are expensive and men like watching sports and drinking beer?)  the world is already full of crashing bores as it is.  so why not save your time and money and listen to the smiths' ""meat is murder"" while reading john kennedy toole's deliciously dark ""a confederacy of dunces"" instead. the world is full of crashing bores..."	2

"in this detailed and well-researched account, psychologist robert j. lifton chronicles the holocaust from a unique perspective:  the role played by nazi medical doctors.  in doing so he explains the nazi philosophy that formed the basis for mass murder:  the necessity to heal the ills of german society by eliminating all its corrupting influences.  healing was and is the raison d'etre for the medical profession.  doctors were thus compelled to become killers in the application of this all encompassing ""cure.""    lifton traces the evolution of the holocaust beginning with the ""euthanasia"" projects of the 30's.  anyone incapable of being a productive member of society was consided, ""life unworthy of life"" and euthanized.   initially this was confined to the mentally challenged and the old/infirmed.  later even severely wounded german soldiers were not spared.  execution technology perfected here formed the basis for the mass executions conducted later.    lifton interviews many physicians in this work including some former nazi's and many jewish doctors forced to work at auschwitz.  here, the inner conflicts of persons trained to heal but actively involved in killing reached its apex.  reactions varied from the cold, view of inmates as ""laboratory rats"" and nothing more by josef mengele, to the tortured acceptance of the necessity of doing his duty of eduard wirths.  coping mechanisms included sending others to do the ""dirty work"" when possible, excessive use of alcohol, and in some cases, suicide.  still, the work went on, despite any internal contradictions.    this is the first work i have seen that explained the nazi philosophy and its impact on the holocaust.  because it was the stated goal of national socialism to cleanse german society of all its ills, the participation of healers was essential.  the nazi's never wavered in this twisted belief.  would the holocaust have occurred without the doctor's participation?  undoubtedly, yes!  however doe's this excuse their participation?  you the reader must decide.  a great read.  five stars!!    harold y. grooms.

"unfortunately for the morons who continue to churn out these silly little tracts (i won't insult ""books"" by calling this that) the only one of our ""founding fathers"" who ever wanted anything even resembling a christian nation (the phrase he used was ""christian sparta"") was patrick henry, and he didn't even sign the constitution!    the other founders from jefferson to franklin were deists, freebelievers, agnostics, atheists, or at the very least non-comformists like george washington.  who, despite ""belonging"" to a church requiring it (martha's), never took commmunion in his entire life.    jefferson who rewrote the bible, editing out any of the magical ""donkey's can talk, people can fly, and a man named jesus lives up in the sky"" nonsense so dear to christians, certainly wasn't a xtian.    adams said that the only thing that came out of religion and the state interacting was tyranny.    geez kids i hate to burst you ""holier than thou"" bubble but america isn't a christian nation, has never been a christian nation, and as long as truely freedom-loving people have breath in their body will never be a christian nation. more jerry fallwell ****"	0

john calvin blazed the trail for most reformed reviewers: if you disagree with what is said, kill the 'sayer'.  ad hominem critique, attempting to discredit an idea by crushing its advocate, is particularly odious in theological discussion but many of the chapters is this book raise it to an art form.    the argument of this book:   the classical description of god = the biblical description of god: take our word for it, we are the experts, no discussion needed.    anyone who disagrees with us is obviously inspired by satan to destroy christianity.    god loves only people who think like us - to hell (literally) with the others.    classical theology presents a picture of god as a disconnected (in his ultimate nature), unfeeling, micro manager who chooses to allow evil when he could stop it.  as a recovering calvinist who finally read the scriptures and took them seriously (how's that for a back door ad hominem? i've still got it) it appears god has revealed himself in the bible as something diferent: a loving, involved creator/father who is working with his children to restore a fallen world.    if you are looking for argument by stipulation, beyond the bounds is for you.  if you want careful analysis of germane scripture passages, look elsewhere. when is a circle not a circle?	2

"mr. yancey has no respect for the teaching of the bible.  god is always there when it hurts.  in fact, god allows hurt.  look at book of job.  god allowed satan to kill job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from job and give job a horrible disease.  god was always there.  in fact, god was a part of the plan to cause job to suffer.  why?  on a whim.  satan said that job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so god said, ""okay, give it your best shot!""  sometimes, god sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with satan.  this is the lesson from the book of job.  sometimes, god himself brings pain and death because christians refuse to uphold the interests of the kingdom of christ.  look at the book of jeremiah.  it was god who chose to kill israelites, destroy the jerusalem temple.  in fact, jeremiah specifically states that king nebuchadnezzar of babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by god to bring destruction.  it's like god anointing bin laden to destroy america.  that would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  the bible is clear that god chose king nebuchadnezzar to destroy the jerusalem temple and kill israelites.  and anyone who opposed king nebuchadnezzar opposed god himself.  how does this apply to bin laden.  this is how seriously god takes desecration of his house, the christian church.  god will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy america if america desecrates god's houses.  and opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing god himself.  mr. yancey should think seriously about what god teaches about suffering.  god gives suffering when believers desecrate his house.  god sends death and destruction when christians refuse to uphold the interst of christ.  this is an important lesson for america to learn. obviously yancey is a pop psychologist who has no respect for the bible"	0

"this textbook could be used by college creative writing students just beginning the study of writing poetry as well as advanced students, honing voice, craft, and expressive forms of poetry.  wendy bishop writes a friendly, well-organized textbook that makes learning sophisticated poetic techniques enjoyable.  this trade paperback is a fairly big book 9.09 x 6.28 x 0.83, with 437 pages, presenting a wealth of material in an interesting and accessible manner.  chapters are organized by ""forms,"" broadly conceived as patterns of sound, rhythm, and meaning.  such forms include free verse, metered lines, rhymed and unrhymed couplets, elegies and aubades, ghazals and pantoums, haiku and haiku-like sequences, listing and repetitions, odes and praise songs, prose poems, quatrains, sestinas, sonnets, tercets, terza rima, triplets, and villanelles.  each chapter begins with a clear discussion of professional examples of the form.  next model poems are considered to move from ""reading into writing."" then an extensive and expansive series of ""invention exercises"" appear, containing drafts of poems by students based on the exercises with additional professional examples.  i give my highest recommendation to this text for students of poetry. delightful sophistication"	1
as peale was a wonderfully typical yet extraordinary enlightenment man, so david c. ward reflects these sometimes complex combinations in his multi-layered style.  written with elegant poeticism yet laiden with fact and academic detail, this book is a joy to read. a wonderful balance between autobiographical insight into peale's character and a scholarly take on 'enlightened' american society, ward triumphally balances both the subject and the reader's attention. by applying, for example, philosophical insight to his subject, to art and to historical events with seamless ease, ward makes a great contribution to the study of an age and a man. a masterful exercise in balance.	1

although they are billed as america's cheapest family, i don't think that this is entirely true. i think i was some years ago when the small business i was running failed during a recession. i remember being asked one time what i would do if i had $100,000, my answer was 'pay bills as far as it would go.' i implemented a lot of the tips given in the book and if i had had the book then would have implemented a lot more. the tips on saving money are great.     but, i'd throw in a couple of other points. if this tip saves you $10 but takes an hour of your time, you may be better off ignoring the tip if by working another hour at your job you could make more than the ten bucks.     another point. i've found that there are people who just love cars. they eat, drink and sleep thinking about cars. you can find them at work, school, or in the neighborhood. they are always finding some super deal on cars. when i need one, i go ask several and invariably one of them knows of some super deal for $500 or a $1000.  this is different than what they recommend, but it's worked for me.     anyway, now you can understand what the book's all about. they have found a lot of ways to save money. just remember the other half is on making more. saving your way to prosperity.	1

despite attempts to keep an open mind, i grew increasingly annoyed at the omissions, exaggerations and half-truths passed off as researched facts in this book. the author calls cuba - a country under a dictator which holds  no elections - a &quot;democracy&quot; and extols the virtues of the  revolution without ever presenting the views and the injustices perpetrated  against those who opposed the revolution.  it is a shame that a work which  could have been an objective scholarly book instead is little better than a  propaganda pamphlet. inadequate and biased	2

my twins are 3 1/2 and have not wanted to start potty training. i thought i would buy this book and see if i could have success. the day after i ordered the book, i bought my daughter some princess underwear and she suddenly became very excited about the prospect of not wearing diapers. my son immediately followed suit. unfortunately, the book had not arrived yet, so i just had to use some common sense and good instincts. lucky for me, this worked and my twins were potty trained by the end of the week and ready for school after easter break. i offered no rewards other than praise. i did not use a doll. i did not do any of the ridiculous things suggested by this book which seems very outdated. at the end of the first week back at school, the book finally arrived. i decided to read it just to see what it said and was glad it arrived so late. if you have not bought a book yet, don't buy this one. just use common sense, don't try to train too early and let your child's success be its own reward. you have got to be kidding!	0

having followed the mrs. murphy mysteries over the years, i am sorry to say that this volume leaves me wanting... wanting a good mystery!  ms brown seems to have dipped into a formula method for compiling her books.  what started the series as bright, witty and compelling, now lacks style, substance and charm.  the animals have become more vocal and unbelievable with each new volume and the sidebars into instructional content and social commentary are too distracting.  perhaps it's time to put mrs. murphy and friends away for a bit until a real plot surfaces. sadly disappointed	0
"gingerbread baby is a twist on the traditional story of ""the gingerbread boy.""  matti and his mother follow the recipe to bake a gingerbread boy, but when matti opens the oven too early a gingerbread baby jumps out instead.  as the gingerbread boy does in the original story, the gingerbread baby runs away and is chased through the town by the townspeople and animals.  however, in this version, instead of the gingerbread baby being eaten by a fox, matti stays home baking a gingerbread house for the gingerbread baby to run into.  children will enjoy lifting the flap on the last page and seeing the gingerbread baby inside his house.  this book would be appropriate for children ages 5 through 8.  children in this age group enjoy hearing make-believe stories involving talking animals or toys or, in this case, talking cookies!  i think young children especially will be happy that in this version the gingerbread baby does not get eaten by the fox in the end.  i recommend sharing this story with children for enjoyment at christmastime.    jan brett's illustrations are beautiful and cover every inch of the page.  the authenticity of the drawings of the swiss village and the townspeople is stunning.  each image is drawn with exquisite detail.  the illustrated borders on each page, which give the appearance of being made out of cookie dough and icing, picture additional scenes related to the events unfolding in the story inside gingerbread baby shaped cutouts.  the eye-catching endpapers round out the beauty of the book as a whole. cute twist on a classic"	1
letter to a young gymnast is a excellant book.  my coach recommended it to me, and after reading it, i gave it to my best friend to read.  i was barely able to put it down.  it is not so much a story of nadia comaneci's career as a gymnast as a story of what life in romania was like.  you walk away from this book feeling like you actually were there and know nadia comaneci personally.  i rarely find biographies or autobiographies that are this good.  defidently a 5-star book. 5-stars	1

this is my 3rd pd james book and i have to say i was quite disappointed.  (the other 2 were murder room and a certain justice.)    i found most of the characters to be not terribly believable and one dimensional.  even dalgliesh was not well drawn.    and to make it worse, the plot was not believable.    i agree with someone else who said borrow this from the library, don't buy it. well written but tedious	2
too long-winded. too many seldom-encountered words employed. too much evasiveness by the author, in withholding clear meaning from what he was saying rather than transmitting that meaning to the reader readily, willingly, succinctly and immediately.     a painful reading experience, not an enjoyable one, unfortunately. the author seemed to be trying to prove his cleverness, superiority and literary prowess (all of which he clearly possesses) rather than simply telling a story. it was a relief to get this book over with. the story was good, but the author took too long to tell it, with too many asides and meanderings.    this book is maybe a good lesson in why authors ought to try to be brief, clear, succinct. authors will be taking up the reader's time without paying the reader for that time, and also are locking diligent readers into having to finish a story once they start reading it, and the author doesn't have an automatic right to more time than the story deserves. did this story really need 470 pages of tight-set text?. more is less	2
the premise here is so engaging that i'm not surprised the author got it published, but basically, it's such a self-indulgent ramble that it's not worth the time of people other than the author.    how can a person make the topic of james bond and his 'disturbing world' feel so draggy that it takes real commitment to keep reading through the first 100 pages?  if you'd like to know, read the first hundred pages of this book.    like many, i came to this book expecting very little except that it be consistently interesting and fun to read.  we're talking about james bond here after all.  the author repeatedly reminds us not to take his pontifications overly seriously, and that's fine, but in that case, we shouldn't have to be bored.    i would strongly recommend not reading this book.  it could have been covered in a long magazine article or, as i said, as the occasional comment on a blog about james bond. would have made a better blog than book...	2
"carol berg, in my humble opinion, is the very best living writer of ""dependable"" fantasy...i.e. nothing that offends my sensibilities, but transports me to a place i'd like to be, filled with people i'd like to know. while i consider each of her books i've had the privilege to read as safe territory, her characters are anything but safe, each generally beat to a pulp one or more times in each story line.  some would consider this violence excessive, but it always moves the story forward and promotes the philosophy of pain and hardship's place in selflessness.  a lost concept in the cocoon of ease and comfort in which most of us dwell.      daughter of ancients delivers all the promise of the preceding bridge of d'arnath books.  it is satisfying, suspenseful, rich and so very human...with the delightful tendency of carol berg to often surprise us thoroughly and tie her plot lines together without the too-tidy endings that so many authors fall into.  thank you, carol, for the gift of your imagination and the concise nature of your beautiful writing. the very best"	1

unlike most business plan guides that focus on producing an impressive document, this book actually helped me plan to run a company. it anticipates and explains virtually every potential pitfall for a company-builder. the book transforms the business planning process into something that you can and should use every day. it touches all aspects of analyzing your business and deciding where to go next. i highly recommend it. planning, not just plans	1
i recently read the thirty years' war 1618-1648, hoping to gain some insight into the holy roman empire by reading about one of its turning points. well, i was left rather disappointed. a short book, it does little to set the scene--clearer explanations of the structure of the empire would have been good, as i was left very much in the dark as to who electors were, and what the political structure of the empire was, and what the rules of succession were, for instance. maps were the most part absent as well, and they would have been very helpful to trace the course of the war, the movement of troops, etc. the thirty years' war is a civil war in the empire, in which foreign powers intervened, and warred with each other as well...yet the explanations of what these foreign powers did against each other outside of the empire is somewhat lacking.    so, i'm still left scratching my head as to the structure of the holy roman empire, to some extent. the book did not fulfill the role i had hoped it to play. it certainly did explain to some extent the consequences of the war to the empire, so i did learn something, but not as much as i'd hoped. i would advise caution before picking this book up. holy roman empire, not explained	2
"well-written, though-provoking survey of the social, legal and political terrain of ""family"" policy, and the competing theories and practices thereto. hopefully this will lead to a more intellectually honest discussion of ""the place of families"" in american law. a much needed book"	1
the cover states the book is for &quot;students and nonspecialist&quot;, which i found to be not true.   the best example was in the chapter metaphysics, if you do not already understand the concepts and especially  aquinas` arguements before reading the book you will definitly not  understand them after reading the book.  i felt the book confuses much more  than enlightens. not for &quot;nonspecialists&quot;	2
although the book is filled with very nice and informative pictures, it is nevertheless quite limited. i needed to relocate a toilet in a renovation project. advanced enough, right? well this book was useless.  there was no  information on venting requirments. if you like learning-by-example, this  book may be for you, but only if the examples match what you need to do. pretty but limited	2
this book is required by several women's studies classes around the country.  i feel it is too wordy and hard for many students in undergraduate programs to understand. the main issues in the book are  hidden behind a large academic language that not all students understand.  the points made in the book though, are valid ones. this is a long winded book that could be 200 pages shorter.	2
i'm a conservative blogger who loves to laugh at liberal celebrities, but there's not much meat here.  hirsen's book feels pretty slapdash and disjointed; the writing is nothing special, and the stories have been told with more flair elsewhere.  i wanted to like it...it's just not very good. pretty weak effort	2
this is a retelling of the canterbury tales, very simplified...in some cases leaving out the best parts!  i believe it may have been originally intended safe for children.      if you're looking for a translation into modern english, keep looking.  i am. this is not the canterbury tales!	0
any book that claims to fit real people has to address the issue of fitting pants, particularly for women since we are still stuck with designs based on men's pants.  while these authors have written a separate book in this series specifically for fitting pants, &quot;pants for real people&quot;, this current book is sadly mis-titled and needs to clearly state that it does not address pants.  as 5'10&quot; woman with a long lower torso and a sway back, fitting pants is difficult to say the least.  for an all-encompassing book that addresses fitting issue, see singer sewing's &quot;perfect fit&quot;, which has lots of pictures, clear directions for both major and minor alterations, before and after shots, and deals with all subjects.  for a book specifically for fitting pants, i recommend singers &quot;pants that fit&quot;.  i own both and use both regularly. incomplete book omits key topic	2
first off, i'll admit that i didn't read the whole book.  now i'll say my peace on it.  hacker generalizes broadly about the behaviors and sentiments of both whites and blacks.  though white himself, he seems to absolutely  despise whites across the board as either racist scum or well-meaning but  idiotic.  then he says that martin luther king jr. only came to prominence  as a leader of the civil rights movement because the whites in power chose  him.  it sounds to me as if hacker thinks that the black population were  too ignorant to choose there own leader and allowed the whites to give them  their hand-picked mlk jr.  the thought of that makes me ill.  apparently,  in hacker's world view, everyone except himself is either evil or stupid.   but it was very entertaining. not so good	2
that this book is receiving one star, given the title of my review, should surprise no one.    look, say what you will; i am a classically trained, analytic, anglophone philosopher with a penchant for clarity and rigor.  that is where i stand.  if you are looking for a text which purports to be theoretical, and yet is obviously densely literary and aphoristic, perhaps i don't understand what you're on about, and perhaps you don't either.    this book is neither clear nor rigorous.  where it doesn't mutate truly elementary understandings of science (not to say that either deleuze understands what the difference between science and pseudoscience is), psychology, and economics to suit its incoherent purposes, it avoids any understanding whatsoever.    the philosophical work contained herein is non-starting.  that is, it is not philosophy, as it is neither argumentative, interpretive, nor logical.  there are no discernible conclusions (which is not to say that there are none in this pig latin dog's dinner, but they probably aren't deduced from premisses ) where there is anything like 'argument' at all.    to say that i'm missing the point, you'd first have to show that such work can have a point.  that it violates hard-won conventions of philosophical discourse, which are taken as primitive (i can't tell you how many times the law of excluded middle was violated), is not a victory for this work.  it is a setback.  that it has not been translated into english, but rather some retarded cousin of english, is perhaps partly to blame for my lack of understanding.  i tend only to be able to read natural languages.    but then, again, perhaps my rhizomatic foreshortening (to wit: to shorten is also to lengthen) is in part quasiculpable (that is, retrodogmatically) as a blamematic(viz. contraposto) which tends inter alia to produce (and re-produce, as malreaux reads sartre in referential milieus of darwinian technologies of traffic control) my congnitive disfunctionabilities.    i recommend the work of w.v.o. quine if you're looking for a 'philosophy of our time,' as one reviewer suggested we must. the crowning achievement of (post)modern french philosophy	0

"in these essays, solomon explores in more detail certain topics that he had only been able to touch on more generally in the earlier, full-fledged biography he had written of beethoven. (he has since followed up more essays strictly on ""late beethoven."")  i find these essays thoughtful, probing, and lucid--not least the fine essay on beethoven's genuine but ambivalent quest for faith.  --frank burch brow. lucid and probing"	1
the best work by twain i've read to date. this combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. i have also learned a great deal about twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the mississippi. written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. highly recommended. excellent	1
i have to say i am a huge pkd fan, and have read just about all of his books.  and before you dismiss this review, know that i read and enjoyed valis and the divine invasion, precursors to this book, the third in the series.  but, sadly, this book just was not the vintage dick classic that ubik, or a scanner darkly was.  in fact, i was disgusted with this book, and to date, i have loved every one of dick's books, even the more obscure ones (galactic pot healer).  though ubik and my personal favorite now wait for last year had a strong, cohesive plot littered with welcome digressions and departures, i can't help thinking that transmigration was just one long digression lacking any sort of structure, and without the strong and interesting characters in dick's other books.  with a slew of obscure references to various operas, epic poems, and other pieces of the impotent intellectual vangaurd, it seemed dick was trying to prove to us his cultural superiority and sophistication.  and that is not the philip k. dick i know and admire.  i suppose if you feel compelled to read everything that dick has written, then read this, but do yourself a favor and borrow it because it is not a book that you will want to re-read. thoroughly disappointing	2
i've loved jeanne ray's other books (julie & romeo, step ball change, and eat cake). i found them all to be well written, funny and entertaining reads, with varied and likeable characters. this book doesn't come close to meeting the standard set by the others. it isn't funny at all. all of the characters act horribly, including the martyred julie who lets everyone in her family walk all over her. i haven't read a book in a long time where i didn't like a single character. (and i liked these people in the first book - julie and romeo). i highly recommend her other books, but i'd stay away from this one. disappointing sequel	2
"a stunningly mediocre book. unorthodox,  revisionist stances, can often be bracing. johnson's are merely inane. he seem incapable of seeing with a sympathetic eye. his biases are pervasive and uninteresting. so one can ""learn"" from johnson that giotto is ""wooden""; that artemisia gentlischi  ""weakness was that she was overweight""; that cezanne is a  ""would be realist"" producing ""crude"" pieces which are ""stiff and awkward and anatomically incorrect....clumsily painted ( johnson reaches this conclusion by comparing him to chardin!) and  that cezanne's reputation is really only a result of ""commerce.  johnson  eye is so dead and his theories so skewed that he is obliged to excoriate virtually all art from the twentieth century onward as mere ""fashion art"" and ""higher frivolity"". wretched history to be sure--but hardly ""new. the insentive eye"	0
this was the bible i used for a project, i loved the ideas and i named the classes after the names in this book.    however, 3 years later, after reviewing this book, i would say, many ideas in the book are already outdated and over emphasized in the past. just remember the good old days when ejb was glorious and almost every company went for it.    after the ejb rush, now when we are back to basic, we realized that many plain old design patterns are real gold. i would suggest you don't rely heavily on j2ee, focus on domain design instead.    many books provide this advice on domain driven development, such as design patterns, refactoring, domain driven design.     after you read those books, then read this book again. you will agree with this review.    http://www.amazon.com/books-for-professional-java-developers/lm/r34sz976nxxd22/ref=cm_lm_byauthor_title_full/104-7074534-463355. it is outdated.	0
there is something for every woman is this book. rather you're lesbian, bisexual, or heterosexual. it is one of my all time favorites. i was really struggling with my sexuality when i came across this book. it helped me to understand that i wasn't alone out there, and that every women deserves satisfaction sexually just as men do in our society today. satisfaction	1

"sallie ann glassman is not a mambo! she does attempt to pimp lwa for her performances and for her weekly ""ceremonies"". any serious mambo and hougan (and even practitioner of haitian vodou) will laugh when they hear the following: sallie ann glassman's ""house"" does not have grades! traditional haitian vodou knows 3 grades of initiation! sallie ann glassman does not perform the priye ginea because it was catholic... she opted for an invocation to the four directions and four elements lifted from either the oto or wicca or enochian tradition, but done in french, to sound like creole - so the average tourist would not know that it was just some invocation from another tradition that had nothing to do with vodou. when she takes people to haiti for initiation (remember: no grades!) she gives them pot tets filled with a feather and 2 or 3 other items. she does not teach passwords or handshakes to her initiates - who, again, have not received any grade! to make a long story short, this book and the author are great bogus and have nothing to do with real haitian vodou. great bogus!"	0
what an amazing account of a surgeon's life!  i loved this book.  starkly honest, the writer does not spare herself.  gripping, heartrending accounts of former patients and the training of a surgeon.  i couldn't put it down.  why aren't all surgeons so caring?  some of the reasons are explained in this book. a must read	1
"i was excited when i saw this book with such a title.  but it turned out to be one of the worst (popular math book) i have read in the last few years.  then i read the review by sporkdude on november 7, 2004 (thanks sporkdude!).  he made some very good suggestions (that we should ignore all the odd chapters but a handful of pages, if not ignore the whole book at all).  i gave the book a  second chance, but it just once again confirmed that it's a really badly written book.  i can tell you why.    on page xiii of the book, the auther claims that ""i don't believe the riemann hypothesis can be explained using math more elementary than i have used here, so if you don't understand the hypothesis after finishing my book, you can be pretty sure you will never understand it.""  is it true?  what i am sure is that you will not understand what riemann hypothesis is after finishing this book.  the author never tried to get to the point, or i would say he was incapable in doing so.  even worse, you wouldn't be able to grisp a big picture of what the hypothesis was all about, as the author jumped around too much, that you're not sure what it's all up for.  together with his tedious writing style (e.g. he likes to throw you with some random decimal numbers upto a hundred digits), it won't take you too long to realize it's just a waste of time to keep on reading this book.    it is ""amazing"" that such a book would get an average of 4.5 stars by 62 reviewers.  if it was your very first popular math book and you found it delightful, i can assure you that there're some a lot better popular math books out there waiting for you to explore. one of the worst..."	0
this novel got great reviews and then got forgotten.  that is a shame.  everything you know is funny, sad, moving, and utterly convincing.  ms. heller did a superb job of getting inside the mind, body and soul of man  just past his middle age.  it's quite a feat and quite a book. do yourself a favor and read it!	1
as a fan of nearly 30 years, this was one of the first beatles books i ever bought, and it remains a worthwhile buy for today's new fans. it may not be as detailed or as enlightening as the mark lewishon-type of books, but it benefits greatly from being written in the sixties - and having a firsthand access to the band. hunter davies includes many stories and insights that would simply not be available to today's writers - because they weren't there. the chapter that describes them writing 'with a little help from my friends', for example, is as amusing as it is amazing. and i very much enjoyed the prologue, where davies explains the difficulties he had with queenie epstein and aunt mimi. and his meeting with pete best in the mid-sixties is as poignant a scene as you will ever get in a beatles book. it is stories like those that make the book worth buying. a worthwhile addition to your beatles library	2
this book has not been helpful to me in this first few months of loss.  although it does show similarities people have in their experience of deep grief, it does not offer solutions.  shakesphere and poe may have had similar experiences, and may have written about them elloquently, but that doesn't help me today.  i think this book needs to be targeted to a diferent population than those of us who are looking for answers. for another time	2
"this is a good book if you haven't read any of the other books about feynman.  a few of the chapters have been published elsewhere, such as in ""the pleasure of finding things out"" which in my opinion was a better (more science-centric) book.  this book was more about his personal life and included some interesting information about his experiences with women and his time spent travelling. more about his personal life..."	2
when you mix soft core porn and culturly confused cubans, you get this piece of crap literature. i think their must have been at least 30 different sex or sex related scenes and oh so many other odd things. one example is when one of the characters (a girl) masturbates to her  mother's old boyfriend's picture, imagining him going down on her...uck! the plot is so badly intwined and mixed together you want to question ever reading again! for the sake of literature don't read this!. draming because this book is so bad	0

"if - and that is a big if (the book is fully 600 pages long - it helps to fall ill when you read it - i did!) - you have the time and want to invest it for obtaining a first class overview over the great power play during the decade between 1955 and 1965 - the khruschev era - this definitely is the book to read! its authors not only provide a refreshingly new perspective to the (more or less well-) known events of, i.a., the first israeli-egyptian war, the (soviet) occupation of hungary and the cuban missile crisis, they fully succeed in transforming this period of history into a most plausible and very exciting ""story"", in fact, into something of a ""thriller"" (in the best sense of the word). it is the story of a great power desperate to come up to its claim to possess or at least to be accorded equal status with the other - even greater - super-power, the united states or, more generally, the ""west"". in order to achieve that one goal, almost anything would do, even extreme brinkmanship that several times brought the world close to thermonuclear war. khrushev is shown as a man to have carried within himself the dominating characteristics of the soviet union itself, viz., an enormous inferiority complex, trying to combine it with catching any opportunity that would present itself to bring pressure to bear on the other side, even using or better: threatening the use of force, wherever it seemed this might bring political advantage. fortunately for the world, this mercurial leader who disposed of the means to blow up the world (or at least: great parts of it) was restrained enough (be it on his own reason, be it by his more risk-averse colleagues within the presidium) not to actually let the world go ""over the brink"" but to withdraw each time at the last moment. it is the humiliation of these retreats as well as the sense of responsibility displayed by him in making them which, if anything, ultimately cost him his job and earns him the status of a statesman (rather than merely that of a cunning politician).    against this background, only two - very minor - criticisms:    first, there is a really unwarranted ""blank space"" in the book as regards the european economic community (today`s ""european union"") whose very creation was decisively triggered by some of the events described in it (suez; hungary), by making the european states mercilessly feel their own palsy vis-à-vis the super-powers. it is ironic - and should clearly have been mentioned in the book - to see how the very institution for whose creation khruschev bore no minor responsibility - would become one of the cornerstones of the west's economic superiority and thus a decisive factor for the eventual downfall of the soviet empire.   second, even though this would admittedly go slightly beyond the clear scope of the book (khruschev's cold war, restricting its topic to his role as politician), it might have been interesting for the reader to be permitted at least a brief peep behind the veil of this astounding politician's official role into his private life, if only to underpin/corroborate some of the conclusions regarding this most mercurial character!    this leaves only one thing to be hoped for: at least i, for my part, am dying to read part ii: ""the breshnev years"", by the same authors, should it ever come out!. khruschev - a most amazing mixture of mercuriality and idiosyncrasy brought vividly to life"	1

"pat califa wrote, ""our culture insists on sexual uniformity and does not acknowledge any neutral difference only crimes, sins, disease and mistakes.""      such we see represented in dr. amen's book.  dr. amen makes reference to what he considers normal sexually in his book.  like so many clinicians and diastognicians his normality is of a vanilla world.  anything outside of that is referred to as an imbalance in the brain or a disorder.  my own research has been focused on debunking the myths about sexuality that are perpetuated in this book.  the chapter on addictions and fetishes lacks any creative thinking whatsoever.  unfortunately i returned the book to the bookstore due to the limited thinking represented here.      sincerely,  ilona paris, lmhc. not too sexy here"	0

"the best take i've read on lafferty is from john clute's encyclopaedia of fantasy. he echoes the view that r.a. lafferty is his own man, and you've got to read all of him to even start to know what he's about. someone new to lafferty would be better off starting with fourth mansions or past master or reefs of earth or the many volumes of short stories. those books make some concessions to the general reader, while this one decidedly does not.    thanks to wildside press for making this novel available. i had looked for a long time for a ""new"" lafferty novel and could only find more short stories. nothing against those; i read his stories avidly before ever cracking the cover of a novel, but i enjoy it when lafferty stretches out in a full-length work and invites us into his universe.    serpent's egg takes place in the indeterminate future of 2035 when all sorts of experiments are taking place between animals, humans and humanoid computers, resulting in various hybrid offspring. these mega-persons all reach maturity at ten years old, but should they prove to be a serpent's egg, a threat to the ""floating world"", assassins are sent after them by the kangaroo court, seen as a portent in the sky of a kangaroo. the offspring of four experiments join up to form a magic twelve, including in their number a psychic python, an unborn elephant, a wolverine, a bear, a computer, and a few humans. it's all very laffertarian and it probably doesn't give anything away to say that the epilog (written by a whale) claims that half the book is lies.    i had a copy of wildside press' collection of lafferty stories, iron tears, which had a lot of typos in it. it may have since been edited, however, since my edition doesn't have the introduction by michael swanwick included in the newer edition. regardless, this book has few typos and is well-produced. it's also as much reading as a whole book of short stories, just right for laffertarian bedtime reading. laffertarian bedtime reading"	2
"since the end of the cold war and the virtual eradication of the two other great political ideologies of the twentieth century, namely communism and fascism, the victory of capitalism has earned it the right to proceed unmolested and, to a very great degree, unquestioned in its dissemination to every point on the globe.  this, as samir amin author of the liberal virus aptly points out, could be dangerous.  capitalism is a system that has always been based on the darwinian principal of survival of the fittest and as such ""can produce nothing other than an intensification of the inequalities between people.""    true.  so true.  and anybody who takes the time to actually study adam smith's, the wealth of nations, will see that the twin engines supposed to drive a capitalist economy are greed and competition, with very little regard for the actual well being of humans.  this should come as no surprise, as a quick look around at the current champions of capitalist enterprise in america like insurance, energy and telecommunications will readily reveal.      any thinking person must agree that it is at least worthwhile to keep a cautious eye on the current trajectory of unfettered capitalism, and inquiring into its possible dangers is undoubtedly healthy.  in fact, what's needed is a measured evaluation of capitalism as it exists today, both good and bad, with the kind of unflinching exploration into its darker implications provided by samir amin here.        but in the current american political climate where knee-jerk conservatism hold sways and the petty ranting of narrow-minded demagogues is counted as reasoned political discourse, this is no time to inject an analysis of capitalism with anti-americanism and hand-wringing over the demise of socialism.  a book like this advances the issue with only the most restrained and open-minded readers and, for the rest, drags the debate back into the muck of cold war hysterics.      not only does amin reveal himself as a whiney, vindictive socialist who would love nothing more than to see america brought to its knees, but he is an obtuse and turgid writer of the kind only academia can produce.  there were sentences in this book i had to read three times before i could figure out what he was saying, and his annoying habit of loading his sentences with digressive clauses, parenthetical clarifications and coined words, had me grateful that this book was only 112 pages long - i have read 300 page books that took me less time to get a handle on.    all in all, the liberal virus explores some issues much in need of inquiry but does so in a way that is so off-putting that it cannot gain much traction among american readers, no matter what their stripe, and can only serve to hinder the debate.  what we need is a book about capitalism that can open minds, not scare them closed or befuddle them with the liberal self-indulgence of its author. the self indulgent virus, a hindrance to the debate"	2

amazon has not done a good job sorting out the various editions and translations of marcus aurelius' meditations.  as a result, comments with many stars actually may be referring to an entirely different translation.  likewise, hardbound references don't match up with the paperback versions.  i'd recommend that you find a copy somewhere and look at the text yourself before you order. read reviews carefully	2
i was quite surprised to see a biography of james tiptree, jr. at all, let alone such a magnificent one.  ms. phillips has done an amazing job at bringing both the woman and the writer into clear focus. i can't imagine that any details of tiptree/sheldon's life are not captured here.  certainly a must read for true sci-fi fans and well as those curious about the history of women's role in our society.  this bio will win several awards, no doubt about it.  quite simply all you could ask for in one volume. the first and the best biography	1

"having studied the work of joseph ratzinger (benedict xvi) and read more than half-a-dozen works on him, i came to ""god's choice"" with a significant cache of knowledge on the subject.  while weigel's work and social commentary (perhaps best known through his syndicated column) remains a source of contention and, at times, controversy, i was rather pleased with this book.  i believe that the major fault of the work rests in the initial focus on john paul ii (which occupies more than 100 pages of the 268-page book).  like david gibson in his ""the rule of benedict,"" weigel apparently felt it necessary to remind the reader of all the great details of benedict's predecessor - a task i find to be superfluous.  that said, it is a good book.    i was delightfully surprised at times while reading this book to find that weigel had occasionally rendered his advisories an appropriate level of respect.  citing john allen, jr., (chief vatican correspondent for national catholic reporter, often noted by being at ends ideologically with the views of weigel) and others, weigel significantly avoids polemical spin in a way that has garnered new respect from this reader.  however, it should also be noted that there remains a peppering of weigel's clear and present agenda throughout the book.  while at times is appears fleeting or subtle, reader beware that his ecclesial and cultural politics surface here and there.  perhaps one example would suffice.      while addressing his opinion of a ""progressive catholic movement"" and its possible cardinal-elector representatives, he makes the unfounded and impertinent remark:  ""that, in turn, may explain why the progressive project is infertile - increasingly unable to attract the brightest students in graduate schools of theology in the united states."" (weigel 136-137)  without any substance, using vague terms, weigel makes a sweeping statement regarding the state of graduate theological students - as it pleases him.      all in all, this is a wonderfully written work.  weigel is clearly intelligent, while politically transparent, and his writing style engages the reader.  i would recommend this book as a companion volume to the many other works dedicated to elucidating the life and work of benedict xvi (see john allen, jr.'s ""pope benedict xvi,"" h. j. fischer's ""pope benedict xvi: a personal portrait,"" and joseph cardinal ratzinger's ""milestones.""). a nice, brief look at the 265th pontiff"	1

fred alan wolf does a good job of explaining the latest thinking in quantum physics, which he himself concedes to be impossible for us to visualize in many respects, for readers without scientific training.  he does this by adopting a historical approach, following the evolution of man's understanding of the nature of motion from the speculations of early greek philosophers such as zeno and aristotle through the work of ground-breaking physicists such as einstein and bohr up to the most current knowledge about the crucial importance of the observer in determining reality.  wolf includes some mind-blowing speculations about the nature of human consciousness in the quantum universe which should fascinate you even if you find them difficult to accept. mind-bending	2

this is a book that will change your outlook on life in america. it is the plea of one man, crying out against the sytematic infiltration of corporate power and greed into every area of life. in this courageous work, gerry spence takes on what he calls, the &quot;oligarchical&quot; power of the  corporate world, exposing its manipulation of even our most personal  beliefs. on issues from the environment, police brutality, polital  corruption and homelessness, to the dominating influence that this power  has on the individual level, he leaves no stone unturned in his search for  justice in america. anyone who is interested in the social problems of our  country will find this book a great source of knowledge, insight, and even  outrage. this book simply asks the reader to look at american society as it  is, not as it was taught to many of us in public school, and then think  about how these problems can be overcome. deconstructing america's false reality	1
i wanted a good face painting book to use with my three-year-old, but this  book wasn't much help.  it has a good tiger and clown.  other faces in the  book were either too simple to need directions (i.e. paint a flag on the  cheek) or too abstract or scary for my little guy. not enough ideas for me	2
"beatrice ""bede"" dunn became fascinated with wild orchids when she got a summer job with the ontario ministry of the environment. they sent her to the bruce peninsula to map orchids. she spent three months there, wandering around the woodlands, doing some serious hiking and camping-out. when she returned in the fall with fifty rolls of film, she had a new avocation - wild orchid hunting. bede became passionate about ""documenting the existence of a single flower or the breeding ground of a particular species."" in 1984 she and her boyfriend, scott, went on a hiking holiday in the dordogne region of southwestern france. when it began to rain, the couple had an argument about whether to leave their camp and seek shelter elsewhere or to stay put. bede was adamant about remaining and so she did - alone. when scott returned two days later the tent and their things were still at the campsite, but bede was gone, along with her camera, backpack, michelin guide and a book on wildflowers and orchids. no one ever saw the young woman again. after a massive search and investigation, which garnered much publicity, no evidence of foul play was discovered, no body, no crime scene.     mara dunn, bede's identical twin, has never resigned herself to the loss of her sister. she moved to the dordogne after her divorce became final and went into the interior design business, all the while maintaining contact with the police. nothing concrete, however, was found concerning the disappearance. during an antique hunting expedition in a near-by town, mara discovered an old canon camera in a pile of junk. she noticed it immediately, even though the case was mildewed and worn, because it was identical to the cameras her parents had given her and her sister for their high school graduation. she was sure it was the camera her sister had traveled to france with. inside the case the initials ""b. d."" were written, and inside the camera was an undeveloped roll of film. damaged by time and dampness, but still viable, thirty-four photographs were revealed upon development, of wild orchids and a dovecote, taken in what appears to be the local landscape. mara is convinced the photographs document her sibling's final days.     now, almost twenty years after bede vanished, mara, with the photographs in hand, makes yet another effort to find her sister, or her remains. julian wood is an english expatriate living in dordogne and an expert on wild orchids. he is also the author of ""wildflowers of the dordogne/ fleurs sauvages de la dordogne,"" and the man mara wants to assist her. she asks him to help her retrace her sister's footsteps using the photographs as a guide. julian is skeptical about turning up anything new on the missing woman. he doesn't really want to get involved and he doesn't care much for pushy, intense women. besides, the police have copies of the photographs and don't seem very excited by them. when julian views the final picture though, he becomes agitated and as motivated to begin a search as mara, but for different reasons. the photo is of a cypripedium - sabot de venus in french, sometimes called lady's slipper in english. and since this rare wild orchid does not grow in the dordogne, or anywhere in europe, he has his own mystery to unravel - if he decides to become involved with mara and her investigation.     not only is ""deadly slipper"" a good literary mystery, it is really a fun book to read. filled with an exotic cast of characters - from the local bogeyman and his mother, who is even scarier than her son, to the bizarre sauvignac family, (the local nobility), to julian wood's fanatic orchid hunting nemesis and competitor, and the regulars down at chez nous, the town's cafe/bar/gourmet restaurant, plus a french police inspector and his lads, these personages all enrich the narrative. the horticulture tidbits are fascinating, and i'm no gardener. the description of food, wine, the gorgeous countryside - c'est tres magnifique! the setting is france! there is even some romancing going on in between gruesome discoveries. you cannot go wrong, especially if you're looking for something different in sleuthing.  jan. le mystère magnifique!"	2

"i thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, i think it's quite nice.  (too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.)  the moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because...    unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed communist manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a socialist agenda primer.  i don't know for sure that's what marcus pfister had as an aim, and i'm not going to speculate on his politics.  he has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat.    yes, i suppose sharing is nice.  certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in america, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced).  furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily better, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it?  is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)?  is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad?    almost seems like it, at least to me.  furthermore, there's an overtone of ""only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth,"" which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever i've seen.  of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right.

"the `preface' by james roosevelt jr. says social security racks up surpluses as it had done for decades and will continue to do so. the special interests who want to ""reform"" social security really want to weaken or abolish it. so it is up to the american people to protect it in order ""to promote the general welfare"". al franken's `foreword' wastes its pages on comic comments. the `introduction' says bush's scam would be both risky and costly, they use scary stories to fool people into believing their lies. most americans don't trust bush (p.4). conason warns about the ""united seniors association"" created to scare people into sending them money (p.5)! powerful financiers want to destroy social security (p.6). they use phony fronts to fool people (p.8). complaints and lies about social security go back to 1936; they have been proven false repeatedly (p.10). they can't learn and can't forget.    here's how this fraud would work. they promised a lucrative return on ""personal"" accounts but didn't tell that management fees and substantial risks would drain these accounts. they promised the owner of the account would control their money but didn't tell that choice would be limited. they promised these accounts would be inherited but didn't tell you this would need an annuity that would leave little to heirs. they promised that social security would go bankrupt but didn't tell you this contradicted their prediction of increased growth in the economy. heads they win, tails you lose. in the real world, people making these promises on investments would go to jail.    chapter 1 explains when bush says he wants to ""strengthen"" social security he really wants to reduce benefits (p.22). conason neglects to tell that in 1952 eisenhower promised to extend social security to the middle-class by including small business owners and farmers. he did this in 1953. there is no crisis in social security, and won't be if economic growth continues. if growth is slow private investments will suffer (p.29). chapter 2 tells about the various publicity groups formed to attack social security with lies and half-truths. conason names the corporations who pay for these advertising attacks. they simply lied about privatization (p.49)! billions were squandered by bush on tax cuts for the super-rich (p.50). conason explains the frauds of the privatizers (p.56). privatization was renamed ""choice"" (p.57).    chapter 3 tells about the phony groups who either mislead people to try to defraud them. they make up ""facts"" to try to prove their case (pp.67-68). this chapter tells of their techniques to divide and conquer (p.74). the aarp opposed bush's failed proposal, and described the essential elements for a retirement plan (p.77). aarp won't tear down the house because of a clogged drain (p.78). does the description of ""united seniors association"" on pages 79-83 expose their hidden agenda? chapter 4 tells about the plans of wall street to swindle private accounts (p.86). private accounts are losers compared to social security (p.89). bush's plan to privatize social security because of a lack of popularity (pp.104-105). ""you can't fool all of the people all of the time."" social security was the best-working government program.    the `conclusion' points out that bush has not provided an actuarially sound plan to deal with an alleged future crisis in social security (pp.109-110). the proposed change could not work. the projected outlook for social security over the next 75 years is reasonably good (p.114).

when i decided to teach myself how to work with wire (especially wrapping cabs and other decorative work), i bought several books, and this one is definitely the best for learning. the illustrations are clear and easy to understand (important for me since i'm a visual learner), and the text is informative and easy to read (though not dumbed-down). i've done several of the projects so far and had no trouble (aside from my own general lack of dexterity) completing each of them, with attractive results. the other books just didn't work for me to get started, though i might be able to use them better now that i really understand the basics. if you already have the basic skills, you won't need this, but if you want to learn, start here. want to learn wireworking? start with this book!	1

"hallinan's book presents a balanced tour of the basic knowledge  required for an embedded linux design effort. the subject is  exceedingly large and the author wisely chooses to focus on essentials  such as tools, debugging, and architecture. there is less emphasis on  quickly dated material such as source code tours and build  instructions as is found in other texts. this book will add to your  knowledge... not just your script library.    two attributes of this text are notable: a) this is the only text on  the market with an overview of the latest config_rt technology found  in the linux kernel. config_rt is a new way of reaching real time  performance requirements that does not depend on sub-kernels or  interrupt abstraction. b) the author remains true to making this a  ""primer"". this is an ideal book to start with and lay the foundation  for future learnin. practical advice from an experienced practitioner"	1

nietzsche, who started all this, may or may not have been the deepest thinker since socrates, but he was a stylistic virtuoso. deleuze and guattari, on the other hand, were founder members of a postmodern cult whose watchword is: obscurity = profundity. but while some profound things may be ineluctably obscure, by no means all obscure things are profound.    this book, which runs to 250 pages scarcely burdened by a coherently expressed thought, is in line for the prestigious prize, the golden merde de taureau. it contains, along with much else, the authors' mature lucubrations on the foundations of calculus, which have greatly impressed readers who flunked high-school math. others maintain that these passages are not about mathematics at all, just as the passages about science are not about science, and they may be right. what, if anything, it is about is anyone's guess, and many have speculated, some to their own satisfaction. one thing we can be sure of, because the authors tell us: they are creating concepts. this important work should not be undertaken by those in whom unfortunate defects of education have left a residual respect for language and joined-up thought.    the book was a bestseller in france - possibly the most unread bestseller since a 'a brief history of time', but for different reasons. what indeed?	0
this book makes saltwater aquariums seem easier than they actually are. for one, i don't even think the book mentions the use of reverse osmosis or deionized water, which is strongly recommended by all marine aquarists. the author also doesn't mention the importance of live rock. in fact, he goes as far to advise against using live rock for fish-only tanks! sure, you might be able to get away with not using live rock, but it won't be worth it in the long run. also, i don't agree with the list of recommended filter combinations. one more thing, the book lists an air stone as essential equipment, but the only thing an air stone will do is aid evaporation and cause salt creep! if you have enough movement of water at the surface, you should get sufficient gas exchange. there is, however, one thing the book does get right: its strong recommendation of using a protein skimmer.    this book is easy to understand, but you won't be getting the best information. save your money	0

"my main interest in reading the book was for the information about the nazi fascination with the occult.  i was hoping for something as stimulating as mel gordon's hanussen: hitler's jewish clairvoyant.  i was greatly disappointed.  christopher hale's himmler's crusade doesn't really deliver what it promises.  hale basically pooh-poohs anything connected with the occult, asserts that only himmler took such notions seriously (but was indulged by those seeking favors from him) and then moves on to other matters.  the book draws no real conclusion other than ""nazis were evil,"" which it pounds repeatedly throughout the book.  (i think i knew that before i even started reading the book.)  hale never seems to be sure of exactly which story he is telling.  for a while it seems as though the book is about schaeffer, who led the expedition, then toward the end, it drops him altogether and starts giving detailed biographical information about other members of the expedition (and the people with whom they interacted).   the author goes off on lots of tangents, giving unessential details about minor figures and events that had little bearing on the main story.  after having invested several weeks in reading the book, i am not sure what the point of it was.      the most interesting parts of the book were those that took place in tibet, but the trip to tibet actually takes up only about half the book.  the rest is a long-winded recounting of the rise and fall of nazism.    it seems to me that here we have yet another book written by someone completely lacking a literary sensibility.  the author, christopher hale, is a british tv documentarist.  this book is an appendix to his tv show.  i found it very difficult reading.  in addition to its lack of focus, i just don't think hale is very comfortable with the printed word.  there are pages and pages wherein it seems he is giving verbal descriptions of documentary film footage.  perhaps his tv show was interesting, but the book was a chore to read.  in addition, the author has this maddening habit of inserting inflammatory opinions into his narrative, apropos of nothing and lacking supporting evidence.  several times throughout the book, the author, a briton, makes outlandish parallels between america and nazi germany, which he doesn't bother to back up (because he can't).  perhaps one can get away with this in a tv documentary, but not in a book, where the reader can back up and say, ""wait a minute.  that's a bunch of crap.  where is the evidence are you basing that statement on?""      the book is also rife with typographical errors (some of them giving an unintentional double entendre when for example ""role"" is spelled ""roll"") and misusages of words.  it appears to have not been edited at all.    i give this book one and a half stars, but let's round it off to two just for the research the author has done.  (his bibliography is probably of a lot more use than the book.)  i just wish he had been able to put all this research into a more coherent form and told it in a way that was more comprehensible and more interesting. tedious"	2

"well, lmb did it again. she completely beguiled me!   she has created yet a third universe, after the vorkosigan nexus and the world of chalion, and it is a really plausible fantasy. she introducted the notion of ""ground"", a mysterious life-force that pervades everything, from humans, through mosquitoes and fireflies, down to rocks, glass bowls and shards thereof, and can be perceived by the lakewalkers ""groundsense"". and this notion is very central to the plot (""ground"" comes so early that mentioning it is not a spoiler). so certainly the book is a fantasy, and quite a well-constructed one. it is also romance, and a very sweet romance it is. of course, it is not a book, just half of one. the ending is not an end, you really are left waiting for the second half. but the cutting point is well-chosen, i think i'll survive till ""legacy"" comes out on july 1st. but just barely.. delicious!"	1
"firstly, i must say that it is very difficult to summarize this book in any way. the complexity (and importance) of the material is such that there is no substitute for a direct, mindful read. however, if you are looking for a very worthwhile attempt at summarization, i suggest you read the review by abc ""bb"" (i was persuaded to purchase by this review).    many reviewers have commented that ""choosing reality"" is an ""easy read"". while i do agree to an extent, it seems necessary to note that these comments are true only in relation to other books of the same nature. considering the complexity of the subject matter, yes, this book is an easy read. in comparison to most literature, however, this ""easy read"" statement is perhaps less plausable. my point is this: do not expect this book to be simple (firstly, because it isn't; secondly, because it shouldn't be). this is of double importance if the reader is of a traditional, western mindset. the content of ""choosing reality"" (especially the latter chapters) takes time to fully absorb.  in fact, this book was, for me, the anti-thesis of a 'quick read'. that said, i must say that i enjoyed every long minute of it.    wallace does a wonderful job showing the flaws in scientific realism and instrumentalism, chronicaling the histories and the theories of each. he then thoroughly explains the comprimise, the middle way, the buddhist way: a centrist view of reality. while the presentation of the centrist view was invaluable in its own right, the most enjoyable sections of the book came after this presentation. wallace undertakes the very difficult task of using language to describe how the centrist view can be applied to our lives. rather than just offering a theory, he describes how the centrist view deals with the mind, the nature of ""physical reality"", and the illusory ""self"". the author earnestly argues that the implications of the centrist view are real; implications that will certainly force you to re-evaluate the world you live in. the beauty of this book is that it caters to any audience. there is enough science to make it rational and reasonable; there is enough buddhism to make it real and applicable. i consider this book of utmost importance to anyone interested in modern physics, buddhism, the nature of reality, and/or the self.    finally, i must note that as much as this book is a religious view of science, it is equally (albeit more subtly) a scientific view of religion. as perhaps wallace's greatest triumph in this book, modern science and religion are shown to be infinintely complimentary, both ultimately striving to understand the same things: the nature of reality and our role in it. to this end, ""choosing reality"" is a must read. if at all interested, a must-read"	1

as a novice gardener, i found this book to be extremely informative and inspiring in my quest to create the perfect mulch. the quick reference guide is very useful in that it provides necessary information about each  type of mulch, such as decomposition speed, soil moisture retention and  relative cost. i also found the section of definitions especially helpful  in trying to determine the best mulch for my garden. it's amazing how many  different common products can be used to create a mulch that is rich in  nutrients, appealing to the eye and terrific in water retention. overall, i  view this book as a strong addition to my library of gardening books. how to mulch effectively and inexpensively	2
yes, ginzburg actually contends that the so-called &quot;witches&quot; of old europe were in fact remanents of the old shamanic cultures of europe, and he does make an excellent arguement for it. i will admit, i do agree with him on some points. shamanism is a universal phenomena, and yet (with the notable exception of the lapps in scandinavia and a few scattered myths and legends like orpheus and odin) shamanism seems to have all but been absent in europe, and this has always puzzled me. certainly, had shamanism been widespread in europe, it probably would have survived well into the christian era, just as it has in other parts of the world. as such, ginzburg may be right on the money about the witch hunts and such. regardless of your thoughts on the subject, this remains an excellent book. and if you like it, he has another book, entitled &quot;night battles&quot; about a community of shaman in northern italy. shamanism in europe	1
this is a horrible book written from a very nasty point of view. basically, this is a systematic dismantling of everything sacred about judaism - to the point where the author actually uses the sacred name of god in the book. obviously, the author knew that his use of the name of god would deeply insult those devoutly jewish, and just as obviously, the author did not care if he insults deeply held beliefs.    it's important to understand that this is coming from a man that feels that what is now israel will soon no longer exist as the jewish homeland - and he demonstrates absolutely no concern for that, either.    no concern for the basics of the jewish religion, disdain for the jewish homeland, and disdain for the future of the jewish race. anti-religion, anti-judaism, anti-israel. there's a word for that. nasty and profane	0

this book was an incredible waste of time. i felt that the essays were a) far too dated (a rambling discourse on the dangers of cookies) or b) too out of touch (rape in cyberspace was not a real rape in cyberspace, folks) the authors seem to be mainly scholars without a tech background than technical folks and i have to agree that the thesaurus was in heavy use during the writing of most of the these essays. finally the book contains very little practical information on cyberethics. not even a single case study. waste of time	0
after reading this book as i did, you may have a great feeling of confidence and a new interest in the game of craps. don't get carried away though. there are studies that refute any influencing of the dice by dice setters. the only studies mentioned are by those who are selling dice setter information. the methods in the book are certainly worth experimenting with, but not with your hard earned money. if you have been to vegas recently its apparent that many people have read this book and are trying out the theory of dice setting. does anyone think if dice setting took even a tiny part of the casinos profit that it would be allowed to continue? i think casinos love people who have read this book and try to beat the game. vegas would be a ghost town!	0

"a family on vacation encounters a cold-blooded gang, a gullible and naive housewife is struck by a mysterious (but hilariously common) ""illness,"" a 104-year-old civil war veteran is a featured guest at his 62-year-old daughter's high school graduation--each of o'connor's stories portray characters in improbable, bizarre, and ultimately harrowing situations. these tales are weird, surprising, tense, comical, and often unforgettable--but what exactly do they all mean?    o'connor was often frustrated by the sense that readers and reviewers misunderstood both the intents and the themes of her stories. in her first letter to a fan from atlanta who became a frequent correspondent, she complained that ""she was mighty tired of reading reviews that call 'a good man' brutal and sarcastic"" and that ""when i see these stories described as horror stories i am always amused because the reviewer has hold of the wrong horror.""    i think she sells herself short with this assessment, however. her stories are brutal, they certainly can be sarcastic--and the fact that readers confuse the horror is confirmation of the ambiguous and harrowing (and, yes, gothic) underworld her characters inhabit. the reason her stories are classics of the form--and the ten stories in this collection are among the best i've ever read--is not only because they are creepy and grotesque, or because she is the master of the ominous set-up and the unexpected ending, but also because after you've found out what happened you'll probably lie awake wondering why it happened.    ""christian realism"" was how o'connor described her spiritual stance; ""i write the way i do because (not though) i am a catholic. . . .  i am a catholic peculiarly possessed of the modern consciousness."" decades of critics have argued over the theological underpinnings of her fiction, but an assessment by a fellow author named george clay helped me make sense of her themes--and the author herself approvingly summarized his remarks in her own correspondence: ""[clay's] interesting comment was that the best of my work sounded like the old testament would sound if it were being written today--in as much (partly) as the character's relation is directly with god rather than with other people's."" it's not hard to find the ghosts of job, ruth, samson, esther, isaac, daniel, and others in all of her stories.     whether these echoes make for good theology will depend on the reader's own spiritual inclinations--but they certainly make good reading. my favorite piece in this collection is ""good country people,"" probably o'connor's most famous (excepting the title story). describing a lonely woman with an artificial leg who is seduced by a traveling bible salesman, the story veers into an inexplicable climax that is both devastating and melancholy. and those two words pretty much sum up any of the stories you'll find here. ten weird, surprising, tense, comical, and often unforgettable stories"	1
i bought these for my daughter aged 5, but i have found that both my 5 and 7 year are obsessed with these dolls.  its 5 months now since i gave them to her, and still (beyond one very beneficial christmas!) they return time and time again to hours of play with the paper dolls.  needless to say, playing with the paper dolls then leads to hours of dressing up themselves like the brides.. absolutely brilliant	1
"this book is of great use for elementary school teachers.  i got a copy when it was first published several years ago and have given several copies to teachers.  when teaching elementary school students, as i did, things must be kept simple.  this is not only true because of the availability of supplies but, also, the ability of the students and supervision needed in teaching the art process.  the author had years of teaching experience and it shows in the instructions given - - - particularly, for those of us who don't have a great artistic talent ourselves.  i purchased my most recent copy for a young friend who is starting her first year of teaching in the fourth grade.  i hope that she uses it and enjoys it.

"i used to enjoy iris johansen.  this book is a super natural psychic thing. the book flap describes it as ""psychological thriller"", but it's not.  if you enjoy the super natural type of book (stephen king, etc) then this is good.  if, like me, you dislike that type of book, stay away from this one.  the main character kerry can get into peoples minds.  the other main character also does that.  yes,that is the basis of this book. big disappointment"	0

"before you start this book you should know that any resemblance between the book and the movies that hollywood has turned out is completely accidental. the names of the main characters are about the only similarity that i could find and as is the norm, the book was much better.    this, the last installment in the musketeer series, gives us the story of the final acts of our heroes, athos, porthos, aramis and d'artagnan. unlike many literary characters our musketeer friends have aged as the story progresses and have all retired but d'artagnan who is still the captain of the king's musketeers. athos and porthos are quite wealthy and aramis has attained the rank of bishop. aramis is not content with his station however and knows a secret that he thinks he can use to become pope. this secret is the knowledge that louis xiv has a twin brother who is hidden away in the bastille and aramis is quite sure that this brother would make a better king than the current monarch. aramis is also pretty sure that the new king in gratitude will nominate his liberator for the office of cardinal and then will scheme to make the new cardinal pope.    in this plot aramis acts alone except for some help from porthos who has no idea what he is involved in. the twins are successfully switched for a short while but then the plot falls apart and aramis and porthos flee for their lives although porthos is still not sure what is going on. the ""pretender"" to the throne is left to his own devices by aramis and is imprisoned in a new location with the iron mask added to his discomfiture. aramis does not come across in this book as much of a hero and in many respects this story is much darker than it's predecessors.     given the advanced age of the musketeers, there are not nearly as many swashbuckling adventures as one is accustomed to but on occasion porthos in particular will rise to the challenge. the political intrigues of the court of louis xiv and the decline of the musketeers are in fact the main plot lines of this story. in the end, only one of the four is left and to find out which one you will just have to read the book. athos, by the way, only seems to play a side role in this story and is neither involved in the plot against the king or in his rescue.     as is always the case, dumas' writing style is superb and is filled with historical fact. he does tend to be a bit wordy and his books are often much longer than necessary but even with this slight drawback he ranks as one of my all-time favorite authors. in this book dumas closes out the careers of his most popular characters and he does it with style. the final bow of the musketeers"	1

this revised version of the gelb's famous biography from the sixties is an incredible read.  it traces the life of o'neill from his early beginnings  to his first broadway play, beyond the horizon.  one gets an in-depth view  of his life with his parents and brother.  monte cristo provides the modern  reader with an enriched biographical background that really elucidates  aspects of o'neill's masterwork, long day's journey into night.  this  biography is clearly written, thoughtful, provocative, and interesting.   it's definitely one of the great literary biographies of an american  writer. incredible biography	1
"this book is plainly boring in every way. the plot should be replaced and the character was completely and utterly uninteresting. the first half of the story deserved a whopping rating of negative 2 stars, and the second half deserved roughly one star. if you have any intention of reading a book that you will cherish in your heart, then i suggest that you would please disregard this novel and find one that is more interesting, like ""barney goes to the zoo"". do not, and i repeat: do not read this book. if you would like to take interest in this novel, save your money and check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. you will be disappointed. boring"	0

this is a great book for a very young child, i started reading it to my daughter at 1. it doesn't go into detail about a birthmother or the actual adoption process. in fact choco looks for a mom like him and finds love in a family that is very different, but is very happy and loving. my little girl loves this book and enjoys the bright pictures of the various animals. i love that it opens the door to explain that loving families can look different from each other... and that is ok!!! i would highly reccommend this book to anyone that has a family blessed by adoption from any country. i love this book!!	1
"daniel dennett's excellent book consciousness explained extracts a very funny cartoon from scientific american, in which two professors stare at a blackboard showing a formula full of complex algebra. in the middle of the formula appears the sentence, ""then a miracle occurs"". one professor points to the statement and says to the other, ""i think you should be more explicit here in step two.""    roger penrose isn't just any old boffin: he is the emeritus rouse ball professor of mathematics at oxford university and has been knighted for his services to science. the emperor's new mind is his attempt to crack that perennial philosophical chestnut, the consciousness/artificial intelligence problem. penrose's view is that strong ai is simply wrong and that a computer could never replicate (functionally or actually) what we know as ""consciousness"".    right. take a deep breath here. for it's a scary thing for a mere mortal (with a decidedly ordinary bachelor's degree in the humanities) to say something like this about the one of the cleverest men on the planet, but i can't see any way around it: in this book roger penrose completely, totally, misses the point. insofar as it's considered an entry on the consciousness/ai debate, the emperor's new mind - all 583 pages of it - is all but worthless.    there. i said it.     then again, nearly 500 of those pages don't even purport to be about consciousness, so perhaps all is not lost. instead, they contain an extremely dense, at times fascinating, but uniformly (and i use the word deliberately) dazzling overview of the more esoteric parts of modern mathematics, physics and cosmology. while penrose thinks it is necessary background, it isn't - it amounts to an extremely long winded appeal to authority:   one is left with the firm impression that the rouse ball professor of mathematics at oxford university is a very, very smart chap, and that one really ought to see that what ever he says goes. this is no small irony, given the title of his book. for if anyone is holding himself out as being a tailor purveying a cloth that only the cleverest people can see, it's roger penrose.    here's where i think he goes wrong. firstly, his attempt to undermine the ai position is founded on purely mathematical reasoning. pure mathematics is a closed logical system. its truths aren't falsifiable, so by themselves have no explanatory force. mathematical statements (such as ""1+1=2"") are necessarily true for all time and all universes so, ipso facto, they can't - by themselves - tell us anything about any particular universe. yet that is just what penrose asks them to do. he invokes gödel's theorem of undecidability, perhaps to counter the argument i have just made, but it isn't convincing - being logically unable to prove all truths in a particular set (even though you know they are true) is very different from being able to falsify them. without that power, you have no explanatory traction in the outside world.  penrose's entire attack on strong ai is based on an unfalsifiable, and therefore non-content carrying, argument.    another error is to assume an algorithm must have been designed for the purpose for which it is used, and must work perfectly to be of any use. natural selection illustrates that this is simply not the case. an algorithm may have a number of useful unintended by-products, and an algorithm can be extremely useful even when we know it to be completely misconceived at every level: take newtonian mechanics as a good example. we've known for a century it isn't correct but in most practical circumstances it works fine.     which brings me to my next point: for all the learning penrose includes on mandelbrot sets, phase space, entropy and hawking radiation, the emperor's new mind is conspicuous for what it leaves out: the bibliography contains no reference to karl popper nor the general philosophy of science - which might have helped him on the issue of falsifiability - nor crucially to a number of writers who have been very influential on the modern mind/ai question: daniel dennett is barely mentioned (dennett's writing probably represents the ""forefront"" of the consciousness debate), nor is richard dawkins well-referenced, despite having written compellingly (and, being a zoologist, with a great deal more expertise) on the question of algorithms in natural selection. indeed, penrose doesn't clearly present the arguments of any particular supporter of strong ai, but rather chooses to generalise loosely as if he is convinced his mathematical deductions can carry the day, and that ai doesn't present a significant challenge. douglas hofstadter is given a little space, and john searle and his largely discredited chinese room experiment a fair space, but other than that the only philosopher penrose seems to be aware of is plato.    another thinker penrose doesn't seem familiar with is william of occam. instead of doing some background reading (and applying a little common sense), penrose has launched a theory which (as he proudly proclaims) takes us to the ends of time and the universe and back to the smallest subatomic particles to explain (in ways he freely admits he doesn't understand) an everyday, prosaic (but still extremely hard to grasp) phenomenon. in its interstellar journey penrose's theory drifts very close to dualism, and close (but not quite so close, perhaps) to positing (or needing) some sort of god to work. that will give succour in some quarters, but not the ones penrose has in mind, i suspect.     occam's razor would require that such untestable and speculative suppositions be rejected unless no other explanation is available. penrose would protest there are none; dennett, dawkins, hofstadter and their colleagues and adherents (including me) would beg to differ, and point to a lot of literature that penrose hasn't read. in any case one would think that penrose's own intuition (which he claims helps him to see truth despite gödel undecidability!) ought to help him see his theory is, as jeremy bentham would say, ""nonsense on stilts"".     ultimately, when penrose says ""quantum theory explains consciousness"" he is really saying no more than ""something magic happens!"" or even ""then a miracle occurs"".    mr penrose, i think you should be more explicit here in step two.    olly buxton. as if by magic!"	2

well researched and documented writing that takes the phony &quot;mask&quot; off many of our elected and non elected leaders. there is a truth that is hidden behind the major news events of our era but it requires searching for. this book simply makes sense out of the murders of the kennedys and mlk- motive/ who's who, and the those with the power to cover up the killings. you will never look at government the same.	2
alistair horne's epic about verdun is one of the best history books i have ever read.  he provides detailed information with the style which makes all the facts flow.  not only does he detail the battle itself, but takes time out to describe the adventures of a german sergeant kunze who infiltrates forts douaumont.  what makes this chapter different is the almost minute by minute retelling of the soldier's activities.  he actually stops to eat in a fort surrounded by the enemy with prisoners he captured locked in a broom closet!     i have previously read how far from austerlitz? by horne and enjoyed it as much as verdun.  this book is the second in a three part trilogy covering the franco-prussian war (the fall of paris) and world war ii (to lose a battle france 1940) all definitely worth the time to read. the way history should be written	2

this is an unbelievably great edition of the canterbury tales.  all i wanted was the original, complete version with definitions for archaic words.  but the penguin classics edition was all i could find, so i got it.  it comes with over 500 pages of extras!!!  super-detailed notes, a great glossary, and lots on chaucer, his times, literary genres, etc., etc.  multiple interpretations are given for parts scholars don't agree on.  i can't believe i paid $80 for the riverside chaucer in college!  ...which i later sold back for much less.  this edition blew me away, and it's relatively cheap.    if you haven't read chaucer and want to read him in old english, it's tough at first, but it gets easier with practice.  there are long tales, short tales, noble tales, bawdy tales, etc.  if you just want to read a few, there are cheaper paperbacks with just a few.  if you want the complete tales but not the essays and things, they exist, but they're more expensive than this edition. a perfect edition	1
it took me a couple months to get through this book.  although there are many interesting clips [from the author's magazine interviews over the years], the book does not hang together.  it appears that the author attempted to weave the stories together into some kind of themes, by decade: but there is really no &quot;greater insight&quot; provided.  i would have preferred to read an anthology of more in-depth commentaries on a few female artists.  i also found ms. hirshey's ornate writing style to be difficult reading. interesting clips, but not a good book	2
this is a highly emotional and well-written work that explores a very taboo subject matter.  the play revolves a case of forbidden love, in this case, giovanni's incestuous love for his sister annabella.  it's pretty easy to figure out after the first few pages that the play will have a tragic ending, but there are several major surprises that happen along the way, and the final scene is unbelievably violent.  i'd love the chance to stage a production of &quot;tis pity&quot; one of these days...from a directorial standpoint, the script is filled with many interesting possibilities. 'tis pity so few people know about this play!	2

the authors of this book purport to tell the history of herb and plant use for religious purposes throughout history.  they especially focus on plants that have hallucinogenic, healing, or toxic qualities.      only trouble is, i find it hard to trust the authors' word on how to use dangerous plants when they make errors so often in other areas.  for example, they claim that henry viii had syphilis, passed it on to his children, and therefore none of them lived past infancy.  ummm...except for the *three* who grew up to rule england?  and in a table of plants sacred to various greek goddesses, they mention that the pomegranate is sacred to hera, but do not connect it to persephone at all, which seems a pretty big oversight in light of her myth.    then, they go on to talk about witches' flying ointments and how deadly they were--but ridicule modern witches who concoct less fatal blends to help them go into trance.    there may very well be treasures in this book.  i'd just be too afraid to trust the authors' accuracy. couldn't get past errors and arrogance	2
the book i am reviewing is the van gough café by cynthia rylant. i think book is great because it's so imaginative. this book is about a cafe where things happen. there really is no problem in this story. it is more about everything magical that happened in the cafe. i would recommend this book to everyone in my reading class. another book cynthia rylant wrote is wedding flowers. this story deserves five stars!  emerson, nj; fifth grade studen. van gogh cafe was magical to read.	1

conservatives will probably dislike it.  liberals will find it a good, fresh rally 'round the liberal flagpole.  i'm a liberal, so it was fun for me.  but have you noticed how the word &quot;community&quot; is becoming the new flashword among liberals?  &quot;we are all in this together,&quot; says mario, so we had better take care of ourselves.  like hillary clinton's &quot;it takes a village.&quot;  the use of &quot;community&quot; is like the use of &quot;opportunity&quot; by the conservatives.  both are code words for points of view that, taken to their extremes, can be far more detrimental than helpful.  americans ultimately prefer the middle.  just remember that, folks, and no one will get hurt. another liberal manifesto	2
this is an in depth look at how london became a modern city through the early victorian transition.  the insight starts with the key to any city the revision of the sewage system to eliminate the health problems and the odor that permeated much of the city from cesspits.  as fascinating is the role of women, which differs depending on social class; unlike romance novels, the author furbishes a powerful look at the growing factory and municipal working class, those below the poverty line, and the servant class too.  in these cases diaries and the writings of chroniclers like jane carlyle and thomas mayhew provide insight.  this is a terrific look at three decades of transformation of one of the world's greatest cities.  readers who enjoyed the recently issued london's thames: the river that shaped a city and its history as well as the author's previous captivating london historicals (see elizabeth's london and restoration london) will appreciate this deep look at the historical era of transformation of an urban center that never slept in the middle of the nineteenth century and still does not.    harriet klausner. in depth look at how london became a modern city 	1

"there's no doubt that this is a gorgeous book.  unfortunately, i think it's better for your coffee table than your kitchen.  while there are beautiful pictures (lots of nigella) and several great recipes, the book didn't seem very useful to me.  i bought and loved ""how to be a domestic goddess"", so, i got this book from the library to check it out, thinking it would be somewhat the same.  i have to say i was dissapointed.  i only found 4 usable recipes in the whole book.   (granted, i am not a gourmet chef by any means, but i do consider myself to be a lover of great food and a good cook.) while there are some nice recipes and lots of great photos this book is a more of a ""pretty to look at"" picture book than a hard core recipe resource. another pretty book"	2

the editors' review would lead you to believe this is an unbiased, thorough and scholarly examination of cultural anthropology.  it is not.  there is subtle age, gender, cultural and religious bias.  although it is a thorough look at various cultures, it is by no means comprehensive or accurate.  it is inaccurate in highlighted descriptions of minor aspects of native american culture, especially of the eastern band of the cherokee nation.  it seems to imply western european cultures and various organized religions are the greatest evil on the planet.  the portrayal of some cultures, such as the malaysian, pacific island, and a few of the african bushmen cultures, are very nice but that is the only redeeming quality of this text.  real scholars should avoid this text at all costs. disappointing for the educated reader	0
when i first discovered that a new burton biography by a professor of history was soon to be published i had high expectations. upon receipt of professor kennedy's burton biography titled the highly civilized man, i started digesting his work. the asserted themes of the work included 1) placing burton and his work in context with the larger issues and challenges of victorian times, and 2) using burton to better understand the nature of changes beginning to percolate socially due to the interaction of victorian england with its colonial enterprises.  indeed, as far as i know, this approach is pioneering and insightful. as i continued reading to about page 90, i thought professor kennedy's effort was well done, and the book would be another jewel to adorn the crown of burton research, along with the work of mary lovell.  i am of the opinion professor kennedy succeeded in achieving both this stated objectives.  from this standpoint, his book is a success.    the observations of burton as a harbinger bridging the transition from the victorian era to the modern era reflect the type of insights one expects from a biographer trained in the rigors of academic scholarship.  i enjoyed the in depth academic analysis of burton from the standpoint of concepts of relativism as applied to notions of cultural difference.  professor kennedy has also highlighted the role played by burton in the early development of anthropology as an academic discipline.  social/cultural anthropology's primary research methodology is called participant/observation.  certainly, this approach was an inherent part of burton's nature, and the scope of his anthropological observations were derived by this research approach.  i was also glad to see that professor kennedy gave particular attention to discussing burton's stone talk and his kasidah.  the earlier biographies did not devote much attention to either of these important works.    as long as kennedy stayed focused on academic based scholarship he avoided the pitfalls that plagued the earlier biographies that predated lovell's rage to live. unfortunately, the book digressed into complicated histories that are not fully recounted.  yet, professor kennedy felt compelled to make several definitive conclusions sorely lacking the professional level of scholarship a professor should be required to meet.  the outcome of kennedy's failures is a setback in burton scholarship. given the effort to place burton in context, the irony is that the book with notable examples omits necessary context to understand and evaluate some of the professor's conclusion. for example, the recounted history of burton firing over the head of a crowd of greek orthodox christians fails to acknowledge that burton resorted to this solution after trying less violent alternatives, and after he and fellow members of his party were injured by rocks thrown at them.  the key point is that burton used a hierarchy of options to confront unstable situations. this point also relates to the absurd conclusion that richard and isabel were role-playing in the desert, and that there is a hidden psychology to uncover.  the decision to have isabel act as richard's son was an attempt to protect her from rape and death, and to give richard an option before resorting to lethal force.  the burtons took their personal safety serious as illustrated by their habit of carrying two revolvers and three bowie knives when traveling.        professor kennedy has a mildly obsessive theme about people burton did not know going into the desert for homosexual interludes that randomly pops up in the book.  he includes a discussion of burton and several earlier biographers who speculated about burton's sexuality. but kennedy failed to note those writers assumed richard and isabel had a loveless and sexless marriage, and they used outmoded, almost now quaint, modes of freudian analysis. the illusion of the burton's loveless marriage was gutted by the original sources brought to light by ms. lovell.  professor kennedy fails to point out the deficiencies of brodie and mclynn concerning their analysis of burton and sexuality. the deficiencies in the highly civilized man about the question of burton's sexual interests are too numerous to address in a short review nor are the issues he raised concerning damascus, crowley and others. kennedy's treatment of burton in damascus is a travesty. not once does the professor inform the reader that all segments of society in damascus worked to bring burton back from his recall. the damascus treatment is lacking in necessary detail and skewered to the degree that the discussion should have been deleted form the book. it is also one of the examples where kennedy included information that is extraneous to accomplishing his two professed themes.     the book appears to have been written with segments produced using an academic analysis methodology with other portions written in an almost stream of consciousness with points lacking critical evaluation.  moreover, there are instances of contradiction. this leads one to conclude the work was not scrutinized properly before going to press. the kasidah analysis includes a conclusion that burton believed there is no god or afterlife, yet in the chapter titled the afterlife, kennedy indicates burton may have concluded there is continuing life. in fact, towards the end of the kasidah and towards the end of note 2, burton makes it plain he has a positive view on a continuing future life. it is not a life however with the attributes of anyone's religious acculturation. the chapter on the afterlife in large part is one of the commendable aspects of this biography.    all of the hallmarks of a work that will withstand the centuries are present in this work if only the good professor would later reissue it, and correct the many deficiencies and expand the themes of burton as harbinger, burton as catalyst, burton as a pioneering mystic and burton as scribe in the manner of thoth, the ancient egyptian principle of wisdom. a pioneering effort	2
"i found this book to be a real disappointment. for starters, lamb is a journalist rather than a scholar. nothing wrong with that, except for the fact that much of the book reads like a ""travelogue"" based on anecdotes and personal encounters rather than a serious analysis of the arab world. he certainly does not have the historical perspective or depth of knowledge of a true middle east expert such as bernard lewis. this book might be somewhat informative to those just beginning to learn about the arab world. but certainly there must be better ""beginner"" books out there.     lamb also appears to have a very limited knowledge of factual information about the region, especially historical facts, as demonstrated by the substantial number of errors in the book. for example, he describes ancient egypt and mesopotamia as being arab accomplishments. but these civilizations didn't consider themselves to be arabs and certainly didn't speak the arabic language, which lamb himself later describes as the best criteria for determining who is arab and who is not. the truth is that the arabs were largely confined to the arabian peninsula until muhammad, in the early 600's, united the arab tribes under islam and began the wars of conquest which were to eventually bring the arabic language to what is now considered to be the arab world, including egypt and iraq. finally, the original edition of this book was written in 1987. the 2002 edition has been partially updated. but much of the book is still outdated. for instance, his writings on the political violence that wrecked lebanon in the 1980's. the arab world is a fascinating place. please do it justice by finding a better book. a very  mediocre tour of the arab world"	2
dr. dichter gives a wide range of examples based on real experiences that expose many of the pitfalls of development assistance as we know it.  unfortunately, while his descriptions of the problems are quite comprehensive, his proposed solution (i.e. drastically cut development assistance in favor of private development) lacks much in the way of logical support.  for instance, there is no contrasting presentation of examples of privately-funded projects that have succeeded where charity has failed, nor any mention of to what extent business relies on government-funded infrastructure improvements, etc.  in addition, the topic is best addressed in two stages -- i.e., is it desirable to encourage development in other countries?  and, if so, are our current tactics the most effective and efficient ways to achieve this goal?   dr. dichter addresses only the second question, but seems to conclude that because the status quo is ineffective, the entire pursuit should be abandoned.  but in general the book is still highly worth reading if you're the least bit interested in development assistance -- it is both deeply enlightening and generally accessible. great overview of the industry, but ...	2
"yes, this is my all-time favorite book, and it begins my all-time favorite series. can you summarize the almost limitless appeal of herriot? i will try. first of all, this book takes place in england, and i am a committed angliophile. it is warm and compassionate without being soppy. it is a timeless memoir that cuts a slice out of the pie of time and keeps it forever. prior to herriot, i exclusively read fiction. not just any fiction, but science fiction and fantasy fiction, both of which are as different from this book as jam is from vegemite (eeuurggh!). reading herriot made me realize that the old saying ""truth is stranger than fiction"" left out something. truth is better than fiction. enjoy wiht my compliments. the best book in the universe bar none except no substitutes numero uno etc...."	1
this is a terrific book on several levels.  first, just the love that these two women have for the people of afghanastan and the picture they paint of life under the taliban is interesting in and of itself.  in places it reads like a thriller, especially when they are arrested and their daring rescue.  finally, just the incredible faith that these women exhibited under such trying circumstances is an inspiration to me.  not that they are perfect, and they are the first to admit they struggled at times in those dark hours in prison, even bickering among themselves at times.  but in the end, their deep faith prevailed and a miracle occurred.   i felt like i was with them before, during and after their imprisonment, and that is a tribute to the great writing of this book.  and, by the way, much of the negatives reviews i've read here sound a lot more like anti-christian bigotry then thoughtful criticisms.  ignore them, and buy this inspirational, wonderful book. more than just a thriller	1

though the title implies it, this book is not really a sequal to the six easy pieces. they can be read seperately. it treats some of the concepts centered around special and general relativity that revolutionized physics near the turn of the century. it would be impossible to find another book that can dive so deeply into topics such as symmetry and space-time, while bypassing formalism and exposing the fundemental ideas and signficance in every-day terms. the delivery is in lecture form, and while that makes it more authentic and real, the fact that this is a book and the reader is not really in a lecture, makes it a little awkward. one often gets the feeling that one had to be there to get the full benefit. there is little attempt at explaining the historical context and other niceties and focus is solely on the concepts themselves. one needs to have at least college level math background to follow the derivations. feynman has done a phenomenal job in reducing such complex concepts into digestable pieces of conversation. there is no abstraction, everything is quantified. i especially enjoyed the chapter curved space, as i had never seen it treated so intimately. the self consistency of all these topics and how they are interrelated is elegantly presented. from a great teacher	2
"although in some ways provocative, this book poses a question it never adequately grapples with--namely, can the ""materiality"" of race be properly characterized or understood as a ""discursive limit"" to ideological constructions of ethnicity without being understood as existing outside of discourse? it seems to me that eng fails to address the question of whether such constructions may be regarded as either a pre- or extra-discursive ""hard kernel of the real,"" one the one hand, or simply another aspect of discourse, on the other hand. his work would benefit from a more thorough engagement with, and analysis of, the ""objet petit a"" in the work of zizek and lacan.  perhaps ""race"" in general ought to be regarded a primordial psychic ""hole,"" an ""absence"" or pure negativity where a ""grounding"" for discourse ought to be but proves to be lacking.  unfortunately that is a proposition that eng hints at but does not explore. ultimately less satisfying than one would hope"	0
this is a good critique of the assumptions made by eurocentric historians over the years about the superiority of europe as compared to the inferiority of the rest of the world.  blaut effectively examines and explodes each theory dispassionately but thoroughly.  finally he comes up with his own explanation for european success since 1492:  america.  europe's &quot;discovery&quot; of and exploitation of north and south america gave it the wherewithall it needed to overtake and surpass the rest of the world.  a well written, well documented assessment which deserves a place beside the great divergence and reorient, among others. pops a few european balloons	1

my wife got me this book for xmas thinking it would help. it didn't. it can be distilled down to two points everyone already knows:    * selling is job #1 in a startup. forget about every other aspect of the business until you have a steady stream of sales.    * don't take on any fixed overhead until the sales are achieved.    thanks for the clarification, guys.    *yawn*. old wine in used skins	2
i think we all agree that we would like to be good and moral people and to raise children who are good and moral.  i have some problems around coles' ideas of how to achieve this.  he disregards well-researched principles of  infant psychology, e.g. that a parent cannot really &quot;spoil&quot; a  newborn baby.  nowhere does he refer to the research of people like bowlby,  who have found an association between secure attachment  between parent and  infant, and psychological health of the child. it's reactionary, freudian and downright scary.	0

this book, originally published in 1881, contains floorplans and elevations of several dozen victorian houses. some plans are possibly suitable for actual construction. as the accurate title implies there are many drawings of architectural details. all plans are drawn to scale, but have been reduced by 12%. this book is a must-have for fans of victorian architecture or home builders that are looking for victorian-style idea. scale victorian house plans and detail drawings.	2
a vitamin every six minutes ranks up there with voltaire's 50 cups of coffee a day. such monomania would seem frivolous were the stakes not so high. ray is simply a baby boomer limping along better than most, until he catches the singularity train of (relative) immortality, which should be along real soon now. except for the occasional howler--alkaline water comes to mind--the book offers sensible advice, though he should have included a chapter on how to raise the money to pay for all the tests, vitamins, supplements, and psychiatrists. live--gulp--for--gulp--ever	2

this is a great book. dahut's analysis of the mindset of the lawyer as he goes about marketing and managing his practice is frighteningly accurate - the way we think as lawyers clearly restricts our ability to be good enterprise builders. dahut's discussion on law firm branding and leadership building was right on the money. i would recommend this book highly to other lawyers - in fact, it should be required reading in law schools. finally, while the book is a little on the pricey side, i got my money's worth and then some.   i give this book five stars. insightful and practical	1
i have not bought this book as i would not let one penney fall into garrison's pocket, but i've perused this volume heavily.  i wish that i could have given it 0 stars.  the author is an unreconstructed confederate  who, whenever there is a remotely possible sinister way of interpreting  lincoln's actions, prefers to submit that view rather than acknowledge the  findings of recognized scholars' research.  for example, he claims that  lincoln is responsible for the creation of the &quot;imperial  presidency&quot;, making possible the abuses of nixon, vietnam, etc.  but  he does not show that lincoln's powers were often balanced by a war conduct  committee, that the presidency went on to lose considerable authority and  esteem in the reconstruction years, and that lincoln himself acknowledged  that, except in the case of national emergencies, as the civil war was  viewed, the president lacked powers to do many things (like the  emancipation proclamation).  garrison also blames lincoln for being  uncompromising and contends, without proof, that the confederacy's desire  to continue as a separate nation would have faded, if allowed, resulting in  reunification.  but most scholars acknowledge that the individual states  would have sooner seceded even further into smaller nations, and that other  states in the union would have found reason to secede into new  confederacies.  thus, as i've said, garrison's trash has been disproven yet  he pretends as though it has not even been noticed by scholars.  it is the  vitriolic spite of an unenlightened confederate clinging to the bitterness  of ancestors.  this book should be relegated to the heap of trash-writing  never to be recovered. vitriolic, spiteful and disproven claims	0

i know that i will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... this is one of only 2 books that i have ever read that i truly regret devoting the time to , but once i start a book i always finish.i don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this.  i just don't get it.  the main character was quite annoying to me and the story was so slow and predictable i really just wanted it to end. i would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you i am sorry. the good soldier	0
i bought this book based upon some of the other reviews that said it was great and they couldn't have been more wrong. i needed the book on short notice so it cost me $25 and it was absolutely useless. there is nothing useful in this book at all. i ended up just winging the toast because i didn't have time to look for another book. waste of money	0
the book is written in a way that does explain the japanese karate training experience very well.  i've done it for 35+ years and his book sums up a lot of things that take a long time to figure out.  i was trained by a former jka kumite champion who came to the u.s. with little english and a goal of teaching karate as it was taught to him and figuring out what he wasn't taught. he is still a great teacher although he has not reached out for the commercial aspects of karate.  the book goes a long way in helping students understand the jka and what is the essence of the karate training.  it will be interesting to see if the author can write another book in 10 more years about what else he has learned. it's a long path	1
i have read everyone of ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. i struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. it never happened. i don't quit many books before they are finished, but i just couldn't stand this any more. waste of time	0
this series of essays reanimates the real feyerbend, too often associated with a series of much denounced one-liners, such as the 'anything goes' pronouncement. in fact, feyerbend rides the dialectical red zone in hairpin turns near the unexplored terrain where science fans, groupies, darwin fanatics, and the 'anally overtrained' fear to tread, lest their weltanschaung be seen as romantic poets once saw it. as a science fan myself, i can only watch in wonder and some sadness the 'social construction', in the age of big science, of something more sophisticated than, but not altogether different from, what the church fathers concocted from thin air, thereby freezing the minds of the many for millennia. it can't happen again, but it can attempt to happen again. that's the nice thing about science, you will lose all your paradigms, sooner better than later. method in that madness	1

"this book from what other reviewers said really doesn't add much new info in terms of the much-publicized deaths of tupac, biggie or jam master jay ... which is one of the big motivations i'm sure most of us consider reading a book like this.    also the fact that this book was written by a cop from the once secret ""hip hop police"" is also somewhat novel.    you'll spend most of the first 20 pages sifting through this guy trying to straddle the fence -- sounding official & professional to rep police but also trying to come off as empathetic and altruistic in his quest to ""save"" hip hop's elite from crime & corruption.    read this book with a grain of salt!!!!    i dropped it after page 21 (go to a bookstore or library and read the bottom 2.5 paragraphs).    parker's basic premise in his defense of policing hip hop is not that he sees the stars as needing protection (which is why soooo many rappers still roll deep, packin' heat!), but rather that so many are still so heavily involved in criminal activity he's doing what he does for public safety.    give me a break.    who's really afraid of ludacris? jay-z? kanye west? chamillionaire (or 50 cent for that matter)?    parker dares to use the term ""public safety"" in this defense and discusses how any number of acts of gunplay could ""breakout at any time"" when rappers are in public.    let's see, we've got ...    a raging war in iraq & the threat of nuclear terrorism.    ongoing police brutality issues.    trickle down damage from crooked politicians.    real crime.    all kinds of sexual predators.    increasingly fragile school systems not to mention poverty, intolerance & all kinds of social ills.    yeah, parker's doing a great job defending society from public enemy no. 1:  poor black men who use hip hop success to rise to a better life.    skim the book's latter chapters for the minor details you seek if you'd like, but i pass on reading more of this crap.    i'm sure he's got interesting stories to tell, but this book just reads like an opportunist looking to make a fast buck by preying on the weak-minded blind enough to believe rappers (code for young black men) must be tamed. i dropped it after 21 pages"	2

a good read.  hurston does an excellent job of depicting the parallel experiences of the captivity of the israelites and the american slave.  in fact, one could argue that the experience of the israelites is the american  slave experience. this is a great book for high school reading, it provides  a variety of cause and effect themes that all young adults need to know;  among them, if you oppress a people or person you breed fear, insecurity,  and eventual self hatred in that human. i highly recommend their eyes were  watching god another of hurston's literary jewels. jewels. great discussion group book	2
my 4 year old son and i stumbled across this book in the library and i immediately knew we had to have our own copy.  the poem that constitutes the text of this book is simple and timeless.  the illustrations are breathtaking.  each painting depicts the same train at the crossing, the various townspeople waiting at the crossing and the contents of the freight cars.  my son loves inventing 'conversations' between the people waiting for the train to pass.  a lovely book that is a nice addition to any child's library. fabulous illustrations...	1

i am now 20 years old and haven't read this book since elementary school.  today, i randomly found the book on amazon and the familiar first edition hardcover. i don't know how old i was when i first read it, but i independently borrrowed it from the library at least 3 different times and enjoyed reading it every time.  i've always remembered, foremost, the cleverness of the dolphins and the anxiety and relief i felt every time i read the scenes with the sharks or the baby being unhooked.  i would say dolphin adventure has made a positive and lasting impression upon me and that every animal-loving child should read it. a memorable story	2
william as always is able to take difficult technical topics and make them easier to understand. i have been running vista since beta one, and this book is an excellent reference for those of us already familiar with  windows operating systems. he doesn't waste your time and jumps right in to explanations of the most significant changes in vista and how these impact working with vista. he divides the most complex topics into easy to understand sections and truly shows depth of understanding.    as an mcse i have enjoyed reading william's books for many years. i started out with his first pocket consultant about 8-9 years ago and have been getting every one he writes since. my understanding always increases several fold while reading his books whether a completely new subject or something more familiar. he always helps you understand subjects better and his always clear and concise approach is refreshing.    you can't lose with stanek's books. he knows how to zero in on what's important. he understands it and writes from experience. this is an excellent book for those of us working in it. my support and developer friends are always stealing my copy of this book. technically accurate and best of the bunch	1
"ron clark is another award-winning teacher who apparently doesn't have a life away from his students.  his 55 rules sometimes cross the line into ""parent"" territory, as when he teaches his children how they should answer the phone at home, and his ""abc's of etiquette"" is subdivided into 26 rules about table-mannners.  he also apparently takes students on field trips that he sometimes pays for out of his own pocket, a questionable practice in most districts.  some of his suggestions, like assigning extra work as a punishment, are just wrong.    new teachers will perhaps be inspired by this book, but there is nothing here that any veteran teacher couldn't tell you.  save your money. teaching is his life - his whole life."	2

the illustrations are beautiful.  the pictograms give parents great ideas  to improvise, and create new movements. my 11 month-old baby enjoys the  rhymes, even though she is not yet old enough to follow my moves as i sing  or recite them, she tries to imitate me.   we have a great time together  and you can always get a smile from her when we sing &quot;wheels on the  bus&quot;  or &quot;i'm a little teapot.&quot;   fantastic book!!. play rhymes	1

"ugh.  this is an example of how academia has invaded and pillaged modern music writing.  this woeful treatise on dai griffiths's random thoughts on pop music and the question of ""classic status"" uses radiohead's ok computer as an unfortunate jumping off point.  most of the book is devoted to the study of pop music, the lexicon of recording conventions, and a labored breakdown of songs, not by sensible musical breaks, but awkwardly by minutes and seconds.  reading this book is about as much fun as parsing a calculus equation.  indeed it reminded me of why i am so glad to be out of school.  it's intellectual masturbation (or wanking, i suppose) of the worst kind.      a choice quote:  ""...ok computer might in time be a focal point for historians of life at the close of the twentieth century.  'this is what was really going on.'  you want to know what 1997 felt like?  ok computer: tracks six - eight.  pushed for time? - track seven.""    track seven of course is ""fitter happier.""  yep.  that song sums up the end of the 20th century, according to griffiths, and naturally, this record.  point of fact, more time is spent discussing ""fitter happier"" in this book than for any other song on the album, a very strong indication of worthless dissection by a rhetorical bore.      another great quote: ""thom yorke is less a songwriter to my mind than a peculiar thing, an 'idea-led word-producer,' the words important as things in themselves rather than necessarily for their place in the song.""    that from the section in the book, ""words.""  and from the section, ""those pesky sound-effect openings and endings"":    ""i'm not sure about those bits, though they certainly pad out the time.""      in other words, the sound design of each song's opening, ending, and/or transitions exist merely to support the author's argument that cd albums are typically longer than albums recorded for vinyl release.  yes, those sonic orchestrations: time killers.    ok computer is a remarkable album because of its ground breaking and remarkable music and lyrics.  this is a solid basis for a book of this kind.  instead, this book is built upon the argument:  ok computer is an album made up of sound effects, music with key and tempo changes, words about animals, death, moods, and electronics, and is remarkable only in that it was recorded for a cd, not a vinyl lp.  in fact, in time it will probably be remembered for being not very remarkable at all.    a note to the editors of 33 1/3: next time hire a writer who actually enjoys the album he/she is writing about. a rhetorical bore"	0
i cringed while reading this book and actually flung it across a waiting area at a gate in heathrow airport in disgust upon finishing it.

mackinnon writes with smoothe, poetic prose, that disguises her petulant and arrogantly low estimation of the average women.  the logical flaws only start there.  the book is deeply myopic in its interpretation of history,  just as marx's work (mackinnon's ideal) was.  i recommend it only because  of the woefully influential effect it is having on the u.s. judicial system  - know thine enemy. a poetic, important, and terrible book	2

"my mother-in-law presented me with this book in a poor attempt to convert me into christianity.     i tried to read the book as thoroughly as possible. it was difficult to keep interested in the first half of the book. in my personal opinion, the author seems to ramble on about the assassination of yitzhak rabin on many occasions, this seems to be his only method of proving that the ""bible code"" does in fact, exist.     not to mention his constant reminding that he 'does not believe in god or prophecies.' this gets very tiring. drosnin does not provide solid evidence, no matter how he tries to dress it up with scientific terms. the author kills his credibility on repeated occasions.     overall, i found this to be an interesting read, but the author's arguements were not convincing enough for me. interesting read, but i'm still not convinced."	2

i bought the book after reading a shorter tolstoy story, years ago. at first i was intimidated by the length of this story and couldnt get into it to start. finally, i picked it up again and was dissapointed i waited so long, it definitely doesnt seem as long once you get going. its an amazing book and has become one of my favorite. loved it	1
as an avid fan and owner of every book she's published i was very disappointed in the storyline, plot, sub-plot, character development (actually lack there of), dialog, i can go on.    when the story moves into dream sequences it's disjointed, choppy and is like flipping channels and watching a movie that has been on for over an hour.    i haven't finished the book, i have no desire, inclination or motivation to.  i stopped reading the book a week ago and haven't felt the urge to pick it up again. i am barely 1/2 way through the book.    i feel like i wasted money.  i feel robbed. does anne also suffer from the curse?	0
i first read martin's hundred when i was in the  hospital waiting to give birth to my first child. i managed to stay interested between my labor pains, and that says a lot about mr. hulme's  writing! i've re-read it four times since. the archaeological details and interpretations are utterly fascinating, especially those of the pointed-roof coffins and poor &quot;granny's hairdo.&quot;  the colonists who inhabited the carter's grove site really came alive for me.  this is an all- time favorite book of mine. life and death in a virginia colony	1
i'd say my title pretty much sums it up. this is one of the simplest treatments of the doctrine of election for almost anyone to grasp. dr. sproul is magnificently insightful and methodical in the presentation of this glorious doctrine of election. magnum opus of election in laymen's terms	1
"this book examines the zeitgeist or spirit of the age, points out what is wrong with it and how to reverse the destructive trend. the modern era is taken as the period 1789 - 1989 and the post-modern as the one that followed. the west is currently in the grip of the pomo mindset, more so in europe than in the usa.     whereas reason was held as the highest value under modernism, it has been ridiculed by postmodernism where truth is considered to be extinct. purpose and design were emphasized in modernism, but postmodernism emphasizes chance and randomness. the post-modern spirit considers values as relative and celebrates unreason and the loss of meaning. deconstruction and contradiction are its gods.     although the modern pursuit was inhospitable towards spiritual truth, debate was still possible because information was subject to induction and deduction. in the post-modern mentality the purpose of debate or dialogue is not to discover truth, since here facts have no legitimacy. debate is therefore impossible.    the first section of the book is titled the moods of the present; it explores the ideas and circumstances that gave birth to the current cultural struggle. the author rigorously investigates the pomo mindset in the light of the fruits it has borne. this part contains interesting references to sources as varied as the great divorce and the pilgrim's regress by cs lewis, the thoughts of gk chesterton and even song lyrics by the moody blues (question) and carly simon (playing possum).    the second section looks at voices from the past, those that have shaped western culture down the ages. as postmodernism mocks the promise once offered by modernity, religion comes under even greater assault, partly because of the faults of politicised religion. theocracy is not the answer. the real hope lies in a change of heart in the individual.     this section includes the poem ozymandias by percy bysshe shelley and an interesting quote by peggy noonan, among others. the author discusses the history of manasseh, son of hezekiah. manasseh turned out to be one of the most evil kings in the history of ancient judah. he was a practitioner of ""multiculturalism,' introducing hideous habits like infanticide from the surrounding nations.     zacharias provides a frightening description of what these sacrifices of children to moloch must have been like. it shows how one person can lead millions into evil, when a nation ceases to think clearly. after manasseh, the righteous king josiah led the kingdom of judah back to god again.    section 3 explores the mystery of evil, with reference to the trial of eichmann and popular culture like the movie pulp fiction in which murder is trivialized. the beautiful poem the coming by r s thomas is reproduced here, and the grace of god and the invitation to redemption are discussed.    appendix a: the ineradicable word is a defence of the uniqueness and authority of the bible, a brilliant apologetics for the veracity of the message in our judeo-christian scriptures. it deals inter alia with the transcultural nature of truth and the transformation of the soul.    appendix b: inextinguishable light, deals with the structure of reason, certainty and the matter of absolutes. it includes a quote from malcolm muggeridge warning of the spiritual plague of relativism. it explains the relationship of logic - reason - truth and the word as truth in the battleground of the heart.    the book concludes with an annotated bibliography of the bible, notes by chapter and a study guide with questions to use as a workbook. i also recommend sinisterism by bruce walker, while europe slept by bruce bawer, menace in europe by claire berlinski, the dragons of expectation by robert conquest, the force of reason by oriana fallaci, the west's last chance by tony blankley and our culture: what's left of it by theodore dalrymple. the rotten fruits of postmodernism"	1
i originially bought this book because i am a fan of mcsorley's and wanted to learn a little about new york history.  i had no previous knowledge of joseph mitchell's works, and did not know what to expect.  i wondered how someone could write a 350 page book about when bar.  then i soon realized that the book is a compilation of short stories about the characters of the city in the 30's and 40's.  primary source history usually bores me, because it is often dry, about someone consequential, and you have to read through alot for a little interesting information.  but the way mitchell presents these characters you are drawn in into their plight,eccentricities, or just regular routines. i highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the city, or if you are a fan of the bar and are just curious like mysel. review for those who haven't read mitchell	1
this is an excellent entry piece into italian fiction (in translation), especially for those seeking works set during world war ii and the rise of fascism in italy.  ranks with the best of international 20th century  literature. by far one of the most interesting novels ever	1
"-everyone expressing a erudite opinion about clausewitz or ""on war"" has completely missed the point here.   -the question is not whether clausewitz or ""on war"" is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs. that is a moot piont to the nth degree.    -the real question is - why would you pay $595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $30.oo ?!?!?!?    -that is the only question regarding this particular version of ""on war"".   -its the economics, stupid !. its the economics, stupid !!"	0
this is an excellent study of what goes on in the mind of the suicidal client.  it is also a beautiful and unforgettable book.  i found it touching and illuminating and it has had a profound impact on the way i treat such clients in therapy. i only thought i understood their psychological pain, but i am more accepting and empathic since reading this incredibly moving book.  required reading for all therapists. a must for therapists	1
"actually i intended to order another book ""ramp plans: learn how to build vert street mini launch and bowls (2000 edition)"", but by mistake seem to have ordered this one instead without realising it before it arrived.  must be my mistake where as i should have noticed this in the confirmation email i got. still, better luck next time.. got the wrong book"	2
the author is obviously as out of her element as inspector monk, and clearly has little knowledge of the ships, seafaring, nautical quarantine requirements, etc. of the 1860's.  her characters are hardly believable:  sutton, the rat exterminator and dr. crow are perhaps the worst examples, but not the only ones.  would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function?  very disappointing. out of her element	0
this book in my opinion left a lot to be desired.  tamara usually has more on the ball than she did in this book.  i know she's no superwoman, but really her deductive reasoning was way off base here.  and, does basil dupre have to show up all the time.  i'm honestly a little tired of him. not one of valerie's best	2
while i don't believe a writer has to follow in his/her own footsteps and write the same type of books over and over, this departure by adriana trigiani is not successful.    while it has the obligatory trip to italy, it makes little or nothing of the trip and since a decorator is making the trip, i would have thought that she would have included a wealth of description here.  instead the trip is glossed over and we are treated to only those descriptions of ottomans and fabric that adorn the homes of di crespi's new jersey clients.  the book is filled with caricatures and not characters and no new jersey italian stereotype is left unturned.  not much of a story and the main character is rather boring as well.    if you insist on reading it, save your money and go to the library. disappointing	2
this was an interesting and fun book.  the good guys are a little bad and the bad guys are a little good, although there are some really bad ones.  reminiscient of the nightside books by simon green, but still totally different.  inspector chen is a good guy who does the best he can, and still can't keep from getting involved with demons.  holds your interest from the first, and keeps you turning those pages.  i liked the short chapters, and the overall format of the book.  the artwork on the cover is gorgeous.  i'm definitely reading the rest of this series.  this was the first liz williams book i have read, and i plan to look into her others. shades of gray	2
thirty years ago dr. kassirer was my chief when i was a medical house officer in boston. (that will serve as my disclosure of possible conflict of interest although we have had little contact since that time.)  he has been a wildly successful nephorlogist/researcher, clinician and teacher. as editor of the new england journal of medicine, he constantly expressed concerns over possible conflict of interest and its influence on published medical literature.  this book is a highly researched and extensively documented look at conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest in the medical literature and other closely related areas of medicine. sometimes there are situations where potential conflict of interest has little or no influence on our decision making. as amply documented in on the take, there are other times when conflict of interest may impact our decision making to the detriment of our patients. this book examines when and how the harmless potential conflict of interest moves into the realm of a serious, even ethical, dilemma.  amazingly, these conflicts may extend beyond the published medical literature to consensus papers and clinical guidelines increasingly embraced by the government and major medical societies and these conflicts of interest  may even intrude into organizations designed to protect the consumer like the fda (food and drug administration) and the cdc (center for disease control).  we as physicians minimize the extent to which potential conflicts of interest influence us in our medical practice - a view not widely shared by patients or government regulatory committees.   dr. kassirer presents a number of suggestions to improve the situation. some of these are already being implemented by major medical journals. others will depend on the integrity of individual practitioners.  this book should be a must-read for medical students - both those planning to do medical research and those who will use the medical research to guide their medical practices.  martin g. kistin, m.d. we're not as objective as we think we are	1
i was disappointed in this book.  i had started getting these books on cd from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few i listened to.  i enjoy the author's picturesque, almost poetic, descriptions of things.  those descriptions were still there, but they did not connect well.  the mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line, not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story.  there is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line.  i felt very let down at the end of this audio book. what does the turkey have to do with this mystery?	2
vincent works for microsoft and has consequently had unique access their development organization. this books reflects this fact with frequent stories and asides - and for which alone its purchase is recommended. there is some good advice and tips in here, however i don't particularly like the latter chapters as they merely descend into an advert for the build capabilities in the (at the time forthcoming) microsoft team system. how builds happen in microsoft land	2

"i thought this book was incredibly slow. it never once peaked, nor did i find it all that engaging. normally there is usually some big finale, or event that grabs you - not here.   the premise of the novel was pretty lame, and the ""bad guys"" were not exactly hard to figure out right away.  all in all very disappointing. boring...not even a suspenseful finale"	2
i received my first edition ordering your private world (opw) in 1985, as an undergraduate. i didn't really like the touchy-feely style of presentation, without any corroborrating references, for example, to the author's science of sleep minimization nor a biblically developed case for journaling. i remain puzzled on many points in the book. contrary to the author's position, the psalmist tells us that &quot;god grants sleep to those he loves&quot;. while journaling can be a productive discipline, could it also lead to indulgent self-absorption? and if the journal is a private work, why would it be a treasure to posterity?       as i realize that the author's life could be construed as fairly disordered, at least from several direct observations i've had of him failing to keep his commitments (from the time of his original opw to the time of this new edition), i feel less discomfort in providing a less than enthusiastic review. during my recent move to a new home, i decided to discard a box of &quot;low-utility&quot; books. without reticence, i included my old copy of opw in the junk box. how ironic, perhaps even spirit guided, my consternation when the current opw was required reading for an upcoming leadership course, and i had to further donate to the author's estate given how i remembered the first edition. perhaps that cost could be redeemed by this feedback.      a basic issue for many christians is living the &quot;driven vs. called&quot; life. i believe that the book will be more convicting to those who are driven, because they may experience some empathy with and conviction from the author, who himself is an admitted driven personality. for such a reader, i can only conclude that replacing the drivenness to succeed with a pursuit of god's calling can only expand his creative purpose and kingdom.      i believe that the author is a fellow believer of jesus christ, and has been redeemed by god for his purpose. i suspect that i am as much as a sinner as he is, but i'm not the one peddling orderly life advice. now that i have now read the latest edition, i am still recommending that this probably is not worth your time or money. too postmodern, disconnected from biblical truths	2
in reading heart sense by dr. paula reeves,i have found this book to be a vast and deep sounce of the most practical and applicable knowledge and wisdom for changing your life from a fate-oriented, sad and unfulfilled life to one of living consciously into your own personal destiny .dr. reeves has given us a truly brilliant blueprint intergrating the current scientific and medical research with the intuitive wisdom of the body mind heart. for me, this is the jewel in an immense array of &quot;self-help&quot; books out there. it is so much more that it falls beyond that catagory. thank you, dr. reeves, for this profound work. a classic in its time	1
a great look back at many interesting and important time periods of ringo and the beatles, happy times, turnoil, post beatles, pesonal up's and down's.  obviously the 4 of them tried to keep contact during the post beatles years and ringo was nice enough to keep all the postcards and publish them for the fans to read. a great look back....	1

"i just finished reading the wizard of ads, and was completely impressed with it on every level. my husband read it first and almost insisted that i read it as well. i'm glad i did. it was very informative and easy to read as well. before reading this book, i was looking at the online reviews and noticed the one titled ""too religious, too partisan, yuck!"" or something like that. after reading this book and learning a little bit about roy williams, i feel compelled to respond to his comments.     this book is in no way religious, and contains absolutely no political content whatsoever. the person who wrote that review apparently found out that roy williams once had lunch with a conservative governor, and that he might be a christian. he thought that reason enough to call williams ""creepy"" and blast a book which it seems he never even read. then in the middle of his review, this guy starts raling against the bush administration and how he's responsible for boring tv ads during the super bowl. what??? this is obviously a bitter person who is just looking for reasons to slam people that might hold views different from his own. but in this case, the criticism couldn't be more unwarranted.    roy williams has personally trained executives from companies such as proctor and gamble, usa today, and many others. the wizard of ads was named business book of the year, and hit #1 on both the wall street journal and new york times business best seller list. you will find absolutely no political or religious activism of any kind in this book. what you will find is extremely valuable advice that, if applied, will make your business more profitable. great book!"	1
the third edition contains material about high gain observers and sliding modes which are  welcome additions. the book also contains sections about backstepping and passivity techniques. as in the first edition the author's writing is clear and concise. it is a good complement to vidyasagar's nonlinear systems book. improvement over the first edition	1
the quality of the recording on the audio series is very poor. it distracted from the message. i was expecting this to be a audio version of portions of the book, but instead they are poor recordings of his sermons. tape 2 of 3 was a recording of someone besides tommy tenney. audio quality is very poor	2
"now that i have a son, i have noticed that he is much different than my daughters.  i was one of those people who thought boys and girls are not much different, it's all about environment.  i was very wrong!  that discovery is what led me to buy this book.  i want to understand my son better.  it started out with some interesting thoughts about how school is not set up for boys, but for girls and that boys are ""hard wired "" to be as they are, but it definitely had a hostile tone toward women.  i do not consider myself a feminist, but i was offended at the author's view of females.  he is a ""masculinist"".  he offers sympathy to the 18 year old patient who impregnates a girl and then is angry that she won't have an abortion.  why should he be involved with a child he doesn't want?  he says men don't pay their child support because the mothers make them angry and they are justified in that.  his views on male sexuality are depressing.  men just want sex and there is nothing we can do about that.  i would not want this guy in my son's life.  most importantly, i consider advice on how to raise a boy dubious at best coming from someone who has never lived with a boy.  the authors has only daughters! i truly don't know how this guy got famous.  i could only see him fanning the flames of women haters. disappointing book"	2
"p.d. james, aka phyllis dorothy james white, has painted the mystery genre with a literary hue which has delighted fans for decades. her writing is stylish and extremely well-crafted. her characters are so fully developed that they seem almost like friends the reader delights in meeting again.  james' heroine in this book, cordelia grey, lacks the long and rich legacy of adam dalgliesh - the author's usual sharp-witted and charming p.i., but she does pack a wallop in the two books she appears in.     mature and wise beyond her years - cordelia is only 22 when we meet her - this heroine knows how to draw us into the murder at hand - in this case the neglected but privileged son of a powerful scientist. brave and insightful sometimes, scared and confused often, cordelia soldiers through this mystery from one deduced fact to the next and arrives at a somewhat unusual (for this genre) denoument. i won't tell you what that is but it causes a bemused adam dalgliesh to pop up at the end of the book in a half-hearted attempt to break down cordelia's defenses.     cordelia is an appealing and well-drawn character who only appeared in two of james' novels. she later, mistakenly she says, sold cordelia, or the rights to her existence anyway, to the bbc, which subsequently did a tv series based on the character.     i picked up this book as a dog-eared paperback in a used book store because the title kept popping up in lists of ""bests"" for this genre - most recently in an essay by anna quindlan. i haven't read a mystery in years but found myself really enjoying this one - for the story, the lovable cordelia, and for the craftsmanship of the author. recommended. top notch whodunit"	1
this is an excellent book for emergent level readers. i really liked the many quarter fold books which focus on both letter/sound recognition and high frequency words. i have used these activities in small group, as independent practice, as homework and in my literacy centers. also included are manuscript printing practice pages that work well as homework due to the detailed letter formation instructions on each page, class books, poetry, and letter cards. what a valuable resource - thank you. activities galore!	1
"dull and inane come to mind. consists mostly of peabody's artificially ""catty"" - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets (even the cat), fuzzy descriptions of egyptian ""archaeology"" (...). the plot is slow moving, cliché and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts. i found more of pennance than pleasure in this read. avoid it. a waste of time"	0
"this once promising and enjoyable series (and i have read every book) has just become too much like an overblown tv soap opera. every time one problem or mystery seems to be cleared up, it either evolves into something else or another situation takes it's place and we have to wait a year or more for the next episode. temple appears to have finally made a choice between the two m's but we all know that's only a deception. the one bright spot in the story (and earlier books had a whole lot more of them) is on page 297 and involves the wonderful fontana brothers doing a james bond imitation. it took me forever to read this book and made me think it would be my last midnight louie story until the end. and i must say it's a shocker and i will have to read the next installment but get a headache thinking things will drag out til the author reaches ""z"". enuff already!!! end the agony & get on with it!"	2
the original edition of this book was out of print for some years and it is delightful to see it out again, and expanded no less. it combines 2 great virtues: highly readable and informative text with illustrations of a quality that are &quot;suitable for framing.&quot; it is a great book for anyone who takes an interest in botany, cooking, or gardening and you couldn't go wrong giving it as a gift to one of these types. it's also great for reference. if you're getting it as a gift i suggest ordering 2, because you'll want one for yourself when you see it. great gift, reference, and coffee table book	1

the newer editions of the delorme atlases are much inferior to, and skimpier on data, than their older editions. i assume they did this to save on printing costs. the maps contain only about half of the data that the older additions had. for example,in the new editions there are elevations listed for only the highest peaks, few of which are even named, and there is no data about mines or springs or many of the other features that the old editions included. other than the newly added gps coordiante data, they are just glorified road maps, which you can get at the gas station. i own several of these from many years back, but am very disappointed in the new editions. newer is not better	0
the arrogant way in which many evangelicals behave has me   believing they themselves are the new world order.here's my   point,if a religion wants to make all other religions obsolete,  have controll of the economy and middle east,advance their   cause in a materialistic manner and rule the earth,this is   truly the new world order.the obvious hatred of anything but   western religion and philosophy could have a frightening outcome.one of my dearest friends lives in colorado springs.her  family goes way back and they are very resentful of the many  new comers whom have made their town a haven for born agains.  you can't walk down the street without the feeling that some   evangelical will walk up to you and start preaching.this is just  a start for them i'd assume.their goal stretches over the   earth,to conquer and controll.politics and religion are tied into one another and this is very common with born agains.in a   sense he is writing about himself and his chrones.can't help but  think they need to look in the mirror to see who the real   anti christ is.jesus never condoned this arrogance. hmm i'd say robertson is the new world order	0
this is a really thin book, and for the price, the production value is terrible. the graphic design, and poor layout, takes a lot away from the information of the book. page after page, you wonder if this recent publication was from the 1980s.    the information was light, and just skimmed over details. there was way too much emphasis on analog. there are other search softwares out there. the case studies were nice, but no real insight was given.    overall - it's an overpriced fluff book. could be summaried in 5 pages. overpriced. terrible layout.	2
i like grant green. i always thought he was one of the four or five top jazz guitarists of his day. he deserves a true biography, rather than the immaturish writing and same old liberal rationalisms for why mr. green failed and died young. his career failed and he died young becauee of drugs---no one's fault but his own. too much politics, not enough biography	2
being a big fan of grant's unique guitar playing, i've always wanted to know a bit more about the man behind the music.  as far as i know, this is the only book about him.  the book doesn't go into a great amount of  detail.  the discography and selected reviews are worth reading.  i'd say  your best bet to understanding grant green would be to spend the money you  would plunk down on this book on a good cd of his- idle moments, green  street, the complete quartets with sonny clark. then you can really get  your money's worth.. buy a grant green cd instead!	2

"reviewed by stephanie rollins for reader views (2/07)       steve chandler has written many motivational books, such as ""35 ways to create great relationships"" and ""100 ways to motivate yourself.""  ""the joy of selling"" is another great book by chandler.  in ""the joy of selling,"" chandler has 51 shorts chapters that include practical, easy tips for maximizing the reader's potential in sales.    there are 132 pages in ""the joy of selling.""  it is easy to read.  the font is large.  it is divided into small chapters.  these small chapters remind me of the format used for desk calendars.  it is efficiently and effectively written.    one of my favorite points is that contrary to popular belief, daydreaming is a waste of time.  in response to a question about the importance of women daydreaming about their goals, he replies ""i think daydreaming is infantile, and i think it is demeaning to women how many motivational speakers try to manipulate women's natural creativity by encouraging dreaming and daydreaming and wishing and hoping.""  he explains his point, ""stop fooling around with daydreams and wishes and spinning around the bedpost singing his name like a bad julie andrews movie...this is an insulting recommendation to women who would like to really achieve something.""    he speaks often of turning our weaknesses into a positive part of our sales persona.  do not hide the fact that you are a normal human with normal human demands and stresses.  he explains how he advised a former waitress to use her experience as a waitress to improve her sales potential.  she did not want to be the typical pushy salesperson, and she felt like less of a salesperson for that feeling.  he explained that she did ""sell"" when she was a waitress.  she let them try to make their decisions.  she occasionally gave recommendations.  he explains, ""when you find your talent for selling, it will become a socratic drawing out of the talent that is already there...""    so if you are a mother and a salesperson, why hide that like it is a dirty secret?  chances are that the person you are trying to sell to is a parent.  if you are way more casual than most salespeople, why feel guilty about it?  maybe you will put your clients at ease with your lack of pretentiousness.  do i sound like i can relate to this?  i can.  i turned being a casual mother of four into a great asset, and i now have a large client base of casual, family-oriented people.    steve chandler's ""the joy of selling"" is a book of great tips.  read it a little at a time.  reading a chapter a day is great.  then you can dwell on the points in that chapter throughout the day.  decide how you can use them.  this well-written book can be quite an asset in your career in sales. thought provoking tips for becoming a great salesperson"	2

i bought this book with low expectation for both the poetry and the story. i'm happy to say that i was wrong. emperor's babe is sexy, stylish and just the most original book i've read in ages. the heroine is a tough little customer, a hip afro roman living in londinium who meets the man of her dreams and loses everything else. by the time you come to last page i promise that you will be moved by her story. and now for something completely different	2
based on property right arrangements, henry hansmann proposed in his 1996 book an organizational classification covering most of organizations under the system of private property.  with the postulate of cost minimization,  he demonstrates convincingly how various kinds of organizations can be  placed into the analytical framework of economics.  in my opinion, this  organizational theory needs only some slight extension to become a  comprehensive one that includes all organizations under the private  property system.  with this extended viewpoint, all seemingly complicated  issues of organizations can be placed into a unified and systematic  framework of analysis.  this is the power and beauty of his organizational  theory.  my opinion is that henry hansmann has made path-breaking  contribution in the study of this filed, following r. coase, a. alchian,  and s. cheung. toward a comprehensive classification of human organizations	1
joseph conrad is my favorite author, and i'm close to having read everything he's written.  this is my favorite novel.  i've read the criticism, that it's too sentimental, that its characters aren't as rich as in other conrad tales...bumpkis.  consider schomberg, consider heyst...well, unless you've read the novel of course you can't.  i encourage you to.  i've read that it was conrad's favorite, and one can understand why, in heyst we get a glimpse into the soul of the aloof author, and in the memorable final word of the novel we get an impression of what he saw in the world.  no other conrad novel with the possible exception of lord jim has so personally affected me, and if like him, and like heyst, you have sloughed off sentimentality, abandoned your romantic side, then maybe this novel has something to teach you.   i certainly learned something. a conrad reader's favorite	1
_victory_ is the first conrad that i have read since reading _heart of darkness_  and _the secret sharer_ in high school. i was unsure what to expect before i picked up the book. in any case, i didn't expect it to be what it was-- so contemplative and so concerned with notions of isolation and the ability to act.     despite the abstract themes, the book is neither slow nor unreadable. an adventure story wraps the whole thing up:     a recluse on a deserted island breaks his solitude and rescues a girl from a life with a semi-shady gang. this act of kindness starts a chain of events that brings violence and change to his small world.     the story moves along nicely, and you can read for the plot even if you are uninterested in the bigger issues the book raises. i found that i was interested in them. heyst (the main character) has been infected by his father's skepticism and analytical viewpoint and never manages to find a way after that to engage with the world or other people in it. his few attempts at engagement are awkward and almost unwilling.     everybody in the book is to some degree isolated. wang removes himself from chinese society to go native. mrs. schomberg is locked behind her mask of fear. mr. jones and ricardo are set apart because of the obsessive fear the gentleman has of women. alma/magdalena/lena is set apart by her past. everybody is trying to connect, but (with the exception of lena) always on their own terms and always within limits.     it's tempting to read conrad's own background and separations into the mix, but i'll leave that to the conrad scholars.     worth reading. distance and closeness and a way to bridge the gap.	2
i have studied some greek and the original texts, and i must say many modern bibles are corrupting the word of god, no only in the unliteral translations but faulty originals they use. the king james version is  faithful, both in being literal and using authentic texts. the new king  james version is faithful in this attempt, the only changes being bringing  the bible into more modern, but still respectful, english, and a few  clarifications of words which have changed their meanings. i recommend it  to all christians. faithful translation of the word of god	1
"oswald allis was a champion of biblical interpretation of the ""end-times"" and of the role of the church in the 1930's. he  shows very clearly the distortions of the bible that modern dispensationalists and the authors of the ""left behind"" books take for granted.    as an example of the impact of this book, i gave it to a confirmed dispensationalist in the mid-80's and asked her to read it and then discuss it with me. she read half of it and gave it back to me and refused to discuss it. invincible ignorance had set in, refusing to even discuss the passages of scripture that did not fit her scofield-induced template of escatology.     the 1945 preface is prophetic: ""is their [the jews] presence 'in the land' so important that palestine should be regarded as belonging to them exclusively, and should they be encouraged to set up a kingdom there like that of david or solomon? should the christians in all the allied countries use every effort to persuade their governments to insist at the coming peace conference that palestine be given to the jews? is this the solution to the jewish question? or, is the reason that the jew is a problem to be found in something quite different: in the fact that he rejected the messiah promised to his race and was 'scattered among the nations' as a punishment for his sin, that he still continues in unbelief and yet still regards himself as a 'peculiar people,' whose destiny is to rule the earth under a messiah who is yet to come?...or, is his need, his supreme need, that heavenly salvation which is to be found only in the christian church?""    another way of asking this is, did the jew's presence ""in the land"" usher in peace and harmony for the jews? or for anyone? read the headlines of today's papers and one can see that this whole enterprise was and is folly, and yet christians still wear their dispensational blinders, and it is staggering to behold.    if you'd like to know more about the end-times, israel and the church, read this book with your bible open. those who do so will have their thinking challenged and appreciation of the scriptures increased.    but i warn you--it doesn't fit the current evangelical mindset and may make you feel uncomfortable with the multitude of ""bible-teachers"" who can't deal with the facts of scripture. funny what logic can do."	1
"i love to read, and have all my life.  i don't know how i escaped reading ""mary poppins"" as a child, because i read nearly every other children's classic book.  i decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because i hadn't read it.  i was horrified as the book went on...if this mary has a heart, i can't find it.  you'd have to use a microscope to find it.    yes, there are strange adventures that are interesting.  i don't have a problem with that.  my problem is mary  herself. she's nasty and mean, and there isn't one redeeming quality about her in the book.  i found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on.    perhaps i was tainted in my viewpoint by the disney version. but i'll gladly take that version, for once, over the book.  at least in the movie mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something.  in the book she's as friendly as a block of ice.    watch the movie.  forget the book. this book was horrible."	0
along with belinda and the history of sir charles grandison, essential reading for all jane austen enthusiasts. in camilla you will find austen's inspiration for many different characters and situations.  the 17 year old  heroine of the novel is burney's most enchanting. her adventures are rich  and surprising.the color of the 18th century infuses this book. bring  handkerchiefs, for there is pathos aplenty, but in a pure, non-cloying  form. eugenia, the stunted and unlovely but spiritually and intellectually  exquisite sister of camilla provides the soul of the book.  this book  contains suspense, glamour, romance, great wisdom and greater folly.   anyone who adores 18th c lit. will be sorry to turn the last page, though a  thousand preceded it.  in many ways this is burney's happiest and most  hopeful book. it was written as she was celebrating her liberation from  spinsterhood into the estate of a married woman at age 40.  we would be  very lucky if anyone ever thought to turn this one into a film. camilla by fanny burney	1
"i am chinese and i love dimsum.  my family would have dim sum every sunday morning in chinatown growing up.  now i married and there's no chinatown or good chinese food around where i live.  so i decided to learn how ot make them.   however i can't read chinese very well.  i bought this book because the recipes come in both chinese and english.      anyway, this book tittle is  ""chinese dimsum"" but the recipes in there isn't  as true to it's title.  there are great variety of food in dim-sum food.   most steamed meat dishes, variety steam dumplings and stuffed rice rolls, and rice cake.   however, this book offers only 3 dumpling recipes. those dumpling recipes are definitely not the kind you get from a dimsum restaurant.   dim-sum is the heart of southern cantonese cuisine.  it's originate from canton china and is a southern style cooking. mostly steamed cooking recipes.  however, the dumpling recipes in the book are water dumpling, just like northern style. a lot more blend.  northern style are the dumpling called for boiling method rather than steam cooking.  well those aren't dim-sum.  northern chinese people eat them as a real meal. the basics such  sui-mai, cao ji. ha-cao. si long bao,  are not in the book.  there great variety of appetizer size meat dishes are also missing.  80% of the books teaches you how to make chinese desserts.  quite honestly, chinese desserts are the grossest thing on earth.   only old chinese people like stuffs like black sesame past bun, red bean paste cake, red bean past sweet rice soup, peanut paste, and yam paste type desserts.   it has 5 or six different king of steam buns recipes, same dough but different meat stuffing.  well, i like steam buns, but it's not the main focus of chinese dim-sum.      i am very upset that i can not find a single recipe that i can call dimsum food. misguided"	0

i'm somewhat of an history buff, especially wwii, but when my mom bought me this book at a yard sale, i didn't know what i was in store for upon reading it.  there are lots of little known facts about hitler's secrets  and his personal life.  we get a glimpse inside of hitler's head to see  what makes him tick - it wasn't just his hatred of the jews that drove him.   the book was just a conglomeration of interesting information, and  contains many rare photos.  if you like reading about hitler or similar  topics, this book is worth buying. facts you didn't know about hitler	2
"this book tries to explain how and why the media would try to send out its ideals to the masses through a selective exposé of certain television programs such as the simpsons, beavis and butthead, ren & stimpy show, murphy brown, la law, cops; political and celebrity personalities like the bush's, bill clinton, william borroughs, phil donahue, rush limbough, peewee herman (paul reubens), the jacksons, madonna, ice t, and even quite peculiar for me even the whole controversy with one of my personal faves u2 over the legal frictions with a parody band called negativland (which is rather more documented on the documentary feature flick of the said group) and even more so about the band that i often refer to -  jesus jones regarding their music video for their perrenial track ""right here right now"" and the advent of mtv's outbreak with the likes of music videos from a-ha; bruce springsteen; and even more so mentioning the likes of `wanna-whats' like r.u. serious, and the cult of genesis p-orrige called thee temple ov psychic youth - the book nearly gives an impression that the author is culture-shocked, and proposed to infect likewise with the `memes' (ie. a term used by the author to refer about the certain data/info's that are being assimilated n=by the media which in turn affects to influence the masses, at least in the way i understood it and could simply put it) it presents to expose - however, the whole matter is subject to the particular perspective preference of the readers personal comprehension.    the book is said to have been ""revised and updated"" from a two-year's span by 1996 - even seems quite un-innovative even from that time, and most of the authors' analysis are nothing new. rushkoff, although being quite informative nevertheless from time to time with the book only seem to mainly dwell on a surface level, when what we need is to see more of the primal motivating factors behind the dissemination of counter-culture trends and ideas which rushkoff attempted to disseminate within the length of his work. ineffectiously infectious"	2

as the title suggests, this is a book about improving your speed.  it is a general book applicable to any sport.  and so the authors go to great lengths to generalize their program.  i expected to read about the latest  in exercise physiology concerning speed, recommended training, and  exercises.  we do get that sort of thing in a manner of speaking, but to  put it very bluntly, this book is one of the most jumbled, mixed up,  illogical presentations you are likely to read.  hard to believe three  college graduates put this together.  in order to get anything out of this  book you kind of have to trudge all the way through it and improvise your  thought process as you go.  the authors give absolutely zero help. do we  get titles to the latest studies on sport speed--in the negative.  do we  get information on the latest persons doing research on the subject--in the  negative.  do we get a logical, understandable training program--in the  negative. what we get instead is kind of a hodge podge of information  coming from all directions without hardly any logical organized  presentation. oh--there is the seven step speed training program presented  in 7 different chapters.  and to give credit--it does look like this is a  good speed improvement program.  however the information  the seven  chapters (and you have to get through 3 almost imconprehensible chapters to  get to the program) seems to rain down from the sky in a very disconnected  fashion.  there are few explanations of the whys and wherefores; there are  zero explanations on where the program comes from or how it was put  together, or where it fits in anywhere in what is being done by any one.   it is just there, presented, and i suppose we are supposed to swallow it  all on faith.  there are presented many descriptions and photographs of  useful looking exercises.  i do know more about speed improvement after  reading the book.  but the information was gotten by pulling teeth. a very tough read.	2
the author has taken his time to present all sides of this important event in south carolina history. by taking a dispassionate look at the contemporary accounts as well as later oral histories he allows one to make up his or her own mind as the the true events. i found no evidence of any political slant.  not a novel for light reading, but easy to read. makes a case as a good text, not only in the realm of black history, but in how one event can be looked at from numerous eyes. gives one a perspective on how the history we come to accept can be changed and minipulated depending on ones desires and point of view.  highly recommend this in any student of south carolina or black histories library. finally an accurate account!	1
"i am disappointed and i haven't even read it yet.  if anything steve has written and quoted out of the book is correct then it is just another case of the blind leading the blind.  please read his review and decide for yourself.  i still plan to buy the book but as with everything else i will take it with a huge chunk of salt.  sounds to me like the so called ""conservatives"" have just put out another book to ""unbiasedly"" support their positions and make it easier to swallow by the masses.  there is no such thing as a conservative any more.  if you want to get back to constitutional government, go check out the libertarian party and view their positions.  they come the closest to truly supporting a government of the people, by the people and for the people.  the rest of them are still just self serving and don't want to let go of their power and your money.    dan. agree with disappointment so far"	0
"this book should have been subtitled ""the art of  assimilated jewish grandparenting"" or ""how to keep your granchildren a little bit jewish"".  if you're looking for a book about that buy it.  if you're looking for a nice book about how to grandparent a nuclear, jewishly oriented family, look elsewhere. not for all jewish grandparents"	0
"i've heard several different interpretations of the book of revelation in the bible, but this one breaks the book down into its respective chapters/verses.  it's easy to get caught up in all the ""fear and dread"" that seems to come from many sources and it's great to read something that is more direct.  the author doesn't claim to have complete understanding, but does clarify some of the mystical language and symbolism.  this book will be a wonderful resource for our religious education classes. ""apocalypse"" is a big help"	2
in the tenant of wildfell hall, anne bronte proves herself to be just as capable a writer as her more famous sisters.  this novel is about the suffering of one woman living in an unhappy marriage, and bronte uses that story to display the desperation of women of that time trapped in inequal relationships.  she also manages to show the strength and cleverness with which women managed to make use of what little power they had.  the characters are well-developed and come alive in every scene, and the dialogue of the novel is very powerful.      at the end, however, the story peters out; though the framing of the novel through a series of letters works well for most of the book, the last few chapters are weak, as bronte tries too hard to create a firm end for every minor character she introduced throughout the book, and it doesn't quite fit with the narrative.  but besides those few pages, this book is solidly written and clearly conceived.  i strongly recommend it for anyone desiring a somewhat more realistic view of the period than presented by either of her sister's novels, but with just as great of writing. inequal relationships	2

this book is a creeper.  a few months after you read it, you will realize that you love it.  kerouak mentions the conceptualization of dr. sax in on the road, where jk's main character talks about a book he is writing, and  mentions the ultimate scene in sax.  the story is full of visuals that stay  in the mind.  inspiration from bram stoker is evident, and mixes with old  radio serials adventure.  a coming of age story that is comic book, before  comic books were cool, and with a fantastic ending that is unexpected and  thought provoking.  a wonderful read every time. highly spiritual	1

"wayne grudem has written a great deal about biblical manhood and womanhood. besides articles in periodicals, he has written recovering biblical manhood and womanhood: a response to evangelical feminism which he co-authored with john piper. he has written evangelical feminism and biblical truth: an analysis of more than 100 disputed questions and then two collections of essays he edited, biblical foundations for manhood and womanhood and pastoral leadership for manhood and womanhood.    the latest addition to this list is evangelical feminism: a new path to liberalism?. grudem describes this book as ""an expression of deep concern about a widespread undermining of the authority of scripture in the arguments that are frequently used to support feminism. it is also a way of posing a question: can a movement that espouses this many ways of undermining the authority of scripture possible be right?"" the book's argument, then, is that evangelical feminism sets those who affirm it on a slippery slope that will inevitably lead to liberalism.    it is important to define terms and grudem, always a deliberate author, does just this. by theological liberalism he refers to ""a system of thinking that denies the complete truthfulness of the bible as the word of god and denies the unique and absolute authority of the bible in our lives."" and by evangelical feminism he means ""a movement that claims there are no unique leadership roles for men in marriage or in the church."" leadership in both the home and the church is to be shared equally between men and women according to their gifts and desires. he leads readers through five points:       1. liberal protestant denominations pioneered evangelical feminism and now evangelical feminists have adopted many of the arguments earlier used by theological liberals to advocate women's ordination and to reject male headship in marriage.     2. many prominent evangelical feminist writers advocate positions that either deny or undermine the authority of the bible. other egalitarians endorse books written by these people without taking a stance against those who deny scripture's authority.     3. recent trends show that evangelical feminists are heading towards the denial of anything uniquely masculine and some now even refer to god as ""our mother in heaven.""     4. the history of others who have adopted these positions shows that the next step is the acceptance of homosexuality.     5. the common thread running through these trends is a rejection of the authority of scripture in people's lives--the very bedrock principle of theological liberalism.    these dire predictions aside, grudem is careful to affirm that there are some egalitarians who continue to uphold the authority of scripture (men like roger nicole, walter kaiser, jack hayford, etc) but warns that, while these men may remain orthodox, those who follow them will likely drift further and further from affirming the authority of scripture, for this is a common pattern in the church. these men, despite their good intentions and their love for the bible, may be inadvertently leading the next generation astray.    grudem provides a short chapter liberalism and women's ordination, showing that there is no theologically liberal denomination or seminary in the united states today that opposes women's ordination. this proves that liberalism and the approval of women's ordination go hand in hand.    the heart of the book is contained in two sections. the first, with fifteen short chapters, examines evangelical feminist views that undermine or deny the authority of scripture. these range from saying that paul's teaching on women's roles was just plain wrong, to suggesting that women may preach or teach men as long as they are under the authority of a pastor, to relying on experience as the arbiter of what is right and true. the second section, with ten short chapters, examines evangelical feminist views that are based on untruthful or unsubstantiated claims. these include those who teach that paul told the women in corinth to ""keep silent"" because they were disrupted church services, that the word ""head"" actually means ""source,"" and that the son is not subordinate to the father in the trinity. grudem concludes ""i cannot say for sure. but i can think of no other viewpoint or movement within the whole history of the christian church (except theological liberalism itself) that has generated so many novel and ultimately incorrect ways of interpreting the bible.""    having provided the facts and having provided brief analysis, grudem finally seeks to understand where evangelical feminism is taking the church. he concludes that the next step is to deny anything distinctly masculine. at the foundation of evangelical feminism, he feels, is a dislike of manhood itself. this will lead to a denial that there is anything uniquely masculine about god and allow people to refer to god as mother. the danger here, of course, is that calling god ""mother"" ""is changing god's own description of himself in the bible. it is calling god by a name that he has not taking for himself. therefore it is changing the way the bible teaches us to think of god. it is thus changing our doctrine of god."" the final step along this trajectory is the widespread acceptance of homosexuality. those who advocate the morality of homosexuality within a biblical context are using the very same arguments used by evangelical feminists. churches that accept the arguments of evangelical feminists will have very little ground to stand on when they attempt (or if they attempt) to uphold the biblical condemnation of homosexuality.    what is ultimately at stake in evangelical feminism is the bible itself. i appreciated grudem taking his argument to its fullest extent and showing what is truly at stake here. too often arguments about issues like evangelical feminism can proceed no further than the doctrine itself. i think grudem has done the church a great service in showing and proving that this discussion is not merely about how particular churches operate. rather, based on this discussion we can see which churches can remain faithful in the future and which will inevitably drift further and further from the authority of scripture and thus further and further from god himself. if evangelical feminism is, indeed, a new path to an old problem, grudem has shown just how seriously we need to take it. grudem builds a good argument"	2

i am constantly amazed at what can get published.  the plot of this book requires the reader to suspend any sense of logic and rationality.  in fact, the plot is so far-fetched i thought it was a parody.  the characters are not believable at all.  the reader is supposed to believe that mozart has been re-incarnated as frankie.  um right.  and i am the queen of spain.  this is the first book by the author that i have read and i am not anxious to pick up another one.  i found the plot lines and character developments to be insultingly stupid.  almost too embarassed to donate this book.  i pray for the trees sacrificed to make this. dreadful book	0

while browsing aimlessly at a local bookstore, this title caught my eye. just coming off of an enjoyable &quot;wandering hill&quot; read, i was primed for more hardscrabble, tooth and nail wild west yarn spinning. that's exactly what i got.  this book is very &quot;readable&quot; and kept me up way past my bedtime with its page turning, brutal charms and smoldering promise of sweet revenge. do i care if it is historically accurate? no.  my only gripe is that the book should be longer.  then again, any more page volume would have killed hugh glass before his time, so maybe it is the right length!  get this book and enjoy. three thums up!	2
let's start with being the nephew of sigmund freud.  mr. bernays witnessed the coming of the industrial revolution in full and his ideas were thus shaped believing that even men operate only as mindless automatons in the larger machinery of society.  the author believes that people are incapable of forming their own opinions due to the complexity of modern life.  heck, these hickams from topeka just came off the farm. surely we in the elite must help them make their choices.    this is the tone of propaganda.  keep in mind that also during this time other similar misinformed ideologies were being incubated by bernays contemporaries like hitler and stalin.  there is in truth much commonality between all three of these mens views.  all ideologies are dangerous and there seemed to have been a great number of squirrely ones developed at the beginning of the 20th century.  bernays does have some karma to pay as this book was used by hitler and the third reich as a kind of manual on how to deceive the masses.  and the third reich is not the last homeland to use bernays ideas. deplorable	0
the book is not intended for students of akkadian as there is no cuneiform or transcripted akkadian. everything is in translation. the book centers around the enuma elish (the biggest creation account), but has many other  smaller creation legends. there is a synopsis of the elish as well as  various theories about its dating, composition, etc. there is also a  lengthy (58 page) article showing parallels to the old testament creation  account. the author does a good job of being objective, but leans toward  showing the uniqueness of the genesis account and contrasts it quite a bit  against the remaining semitic literature. good overview for the uninitiated.	2
the first few reviews are too harsh,i was given this as a gift so i am not as pissed off at the money. i give it two stars could have been three but for the fact that the hero's are way too perfect and they are dull- but it was not a book i expected much from anyway.  the plot also gets way to over the top.  i mean is there any plane or helicopter they cannot learn to fly in a weekend? hero's invited to the summit by the president! they escape four attempts to kill them before they even get to china! also hero knew the guy was chinese just by looking at him for a less than a minute, how many white folks can tell difference among non whites? why are all the chinese americans bad guys as well?    the novel is way to heavy with anit chinese comments, has lot of what are just rants. see the other points in the publisher weekly review, but after considering them you may want to read the book, if you want to consider what we do if we and china butt heads, but have low expectation and know that in this world the good guys always win. do not expect much and look for used copy, i paln to look to see if any of his other books get any better reviews before i cut him off. use caution	2

as in many of his books, jack london enraptes the reader, but this time in a story of love.  it is extremely refreshing because it shows the good side of true love without that sickening sweetness so many love stories have...  i read this book a few years back and read it again just recently. i am   sixteen.  this book is definetly one that many can enjoy, no matter your  age. a testament of love	1
i was very excited to read this book! i ran home, got comforable and started reading. i found myself skipping through the pages. i found it was very myth based, and too much about religion and jesus and mary. i bought it because i love tori and have been fascinated by her. i wish this book was more about her life, her childhood. i have read less then half this book,and i will either force myself to finish, or return the book. i really am sadly dissapointed. tori is the singer and song writer that you can listen to over and over again. i have bought her cd's 3 and 4 times each because i listened too much and the cd was worn. i really don't suggest anyone to buy this, you will be let down, just as i was. sadly dissapointed	2
"this may be the worst book i've ever finished.  i was expecting a book that would offer small tidbits of funny information, some shots, and some glorious facts about the great men who have led our country over the various centuries.  instead, we are treated to a salacious compendium of president's peeing on secret service men and other president's blaming secret service men for farting.  if you are looking for ""the man show"" version of the presidents, then by all means fork over your hard earned dollars. we are informed that every republican from ike to bush were bumbling idiots, and every democrat from fdr to clinton were mere victims of circumstance. if you are looking for a michael moore or al franken version of the historical lives of some of the greatest men who ever lived, then by all means add to cart. thanks to this author's portrayal of u.s. presidents, i will forever read an author's portrayal of the two most divisive presidents of our time, nixon and clinton, before i make such a purchase again. nixon and clinton were both failures in their own right.  nixon and clinton were both men blessed with an overwhelming amount of potential, but they both flushed it away with their individual incidents. o'brien ends each portrayal with an accurate summary of the unfortunate end of each of the individual tenure, but it is within the body of these portrayals that o'brien lends his creative writing skills to the eventual manipulation of the reader.  examples to the point, newt gingrich is snide and rapacious, and kenneth starr is a ruthless republican bloodhound. do we really need these adjectives?  we read no such adjectives to describe the behaivor of the democrats in power during nixon's term. we see no adjectives or adverbs to describe the activities of a woodward and bernstein. i would consider it silly for a compendium of this sort to glorify the presidency of nixon, for his tenure was not one to emulate. nixon and clinton had their otherwise promising presidencies brought down by silly incidents that would've been seen as such were it not for the cover-ups that followed. o'brien goes onto to proclaim bob jones university as preposterously conservative, he declares the great society as a legislative success. it maybe true that the great society was a success in accumulating enough votes for passage, but can the great society be considered a success in an historical perspective? he portrays the anti-american carter as the greatest living former president in recent memory.  he mentions carter's farcical nobel peace prize as testament to this fact. what is this? everyone knows that that prize was a joke provided by the nobel people looking to make an anti-american statement. it should be noted that the great peace activist yasser arafat also won this award. o'brien fails to mention the johnson administration's propaganda involving the gulf of tonkin incident that johnson used to convince american's that america's role needed to be escalated in vietnam. it was an incident historians are now claiming never happened, but this isn't used to define johnson's administration? he maintains that every republican since ford gained office with shenanigans and slick marketing. he ends the book with the moore/franken style rants against the george w. bush election, which many nonpartisan publications--including the democrat miami herald and the usa today--are saying they could've recounted until the end of time and bush would've won.  he comments on bush's slick maneuvering to enter into the war with iraq. i will grant you that this book was written before news of the the oil for food un scandals broke. these scandals involved france, germany and russia, and this scandal may have affected the manner in which pre-war activities were conducted. all in all, shouldn't a book of this variety be written to open debate rather than close it with propaganda material? i found some of the portrayals of presidents one rarely hears mentioned, such as zachary taylor and franklin pierce, but i found myself reevaluating all of these portrayals after reading about those with which i am much more familiar. i am currently an unsuccessful author, but i have written enough, and studied the craft enough, to know a writer's manipulation when i see it. it's a shame too, for this could've been such an interesting idea. as i have mentioned, cormac o'brien has taught me a valuable lesson when buying historical perspectives: try and learn the author's agenda before buying his book. i have read a couple of books of this sort that will lambaste and glorify an lbj or a clinton as often as they lambaste and glorify a nixon or a reagan. while i will agree that it is difficult for an individual to separate himself from his perspective, it should always be the responsibility of said author to keep this to a matter of degrees. it is my hope that the anxious readers who share my love for information, regardless of their individual biases, will search elsewhere. not well researched and partisan"	0
"while reading ludlum in between more artistic works of literature, i like to follow a good spy/action novel. ludlum provides! bourne identity really provides! it went through all things a good ludlum novel ought to go through: action packed, twisting plots, romance, conspiracy, character thoughts, and, unfortunately, repetition. five of those six are gems, but the repetition wore me out nearing the end. i can only read ""charlie is for delta; delta is for cain"" (or something like that) so many times... then i have to cringe, bite my lip and suppress an urge to scream at the annoyance.     if you could have someone black-out all these lines in the book before you read it, it would make the read so much more enjoyable. best of ludlum!"	2

"beinhart has done us a remarkable service by giving language to a new and critically important concept, that of the fact that is neither secret nor known.  by ""fog facts,"" beinhart means to indicate pieces of information that have been published on back pages of business sections of newspapers or picked up by a columnist or two, information that has perhaps been circulated on the internet by those with a passionate interest in the issue and enough free time, information that is accepted as known and established by reporters, editors, producers, and pundits, but which the vast majority of the public has never heard about and would find incredibly important and shocking.      the subtitle that beinhart gives his website is ""known facts that have been lost in the fog,"" and by the fog he means to indicate, as described in his book, the onslaught of abundant facts and information about unimportant stories: monica lewinski and o.j. simpson are two examples beinhart gives.  but beinhart suggests at least one other force that helps keep some fog facts in the fog: people's reluctance to believe a really big lie.  this, beinhart writes, is ""why it was easy to believe that bill clinton lied about having sex with that woman and hard to believe that bush and his entire cabinet were telling bald faced lies about saddam's connection to al qaeda and his weapons of mass destruction.""      in fact, one of the fog facts beinhart discusses is the downing street minutes. important addition to our language"	2
samples taken from wtc steel now confirm (soon to be released by professor steven jones of byu and five other universities) thermate was used in the wtc towers to take them down. this meshes with the global collapse times of both towers (and 7 wtc) and the eyewitness reports that day from firefighters, police, tenants and workers who said bombs were in the towers. not only do we have dispicable people in government who, of course, knew this all along, but the u.s. media knew it too. soon both will be out of employment. stand down	0
this book is a rehash of stuff that has already been said about this product.  it is clear that the author did not close transactions but viewed credit derivatives as an academic.  nothing new is said.  he could at least have written in an original fashion but decided to write about already exposed concepts in a very dry manner. dated and dry	0
"excellent book!  i have a nice collection of pop up books as well as books about their construction.  this book is outstanding.  the drawings are clear in their explanations and descriptions--much more so than photographs would be.  you can see the fronts, backs, sides, edges--whatever is pertinent to understanding the form being illustrated.  one especially nice feature is the author's explanation of things to watch out for--potential stumbling blocks to creating a functioning mechanism.  he begins with the basics and then demonstrates elaborations.  i think his illustrating applications of the forms is inspiring and informative--he goes beyond showing how to make,for example, a pop-up box and uses examples that show what a pop-up box might be.  i consider this book a ""must have"" for those interested in the subject. pop up!: a manual of paper mechanisms"	1
i recently became interested in gardening (now that i have a yard in which i can plant).  this is one of my favorite books on gardening and landscaping.  great resource for those of us living in the northeast.  full of wonderful photos, explanations and illustrations.  it gives many ideas for addressing certain areas of your yard (i.e. front entryway, patio, rock wall).  explanations are excellent; i learned a great deal from this book. very well written.  highly recommended. one of my favorites	1
appreciate the stories told by this author about his life and consider the insights that he has gained from reflection on his experience; but, please, do not base your understanding of quakerism on his presentation.  in spite of the fact that smith is a lifelong friend and a former quaker educator, he quotes george fox (an important leader in the early quaker movement) and the bible inaccurately or out of context several times.  in addition, some of smith's statements about facets of quaker faith and practice are historically unfounded or ignore the diversity within the religious society of friends today. if you are interested in learning about quakerism, read wilmer a. cooper's book, a living faith: an historical study of quaker beliefs (friends united press: 1990).  read robert lawrence smith's book as a book of wisdom written by a quaker, but not necessarily a quaker book of wisdom. 'wise,' but debatably 'quaker'	2
this book compiles about 23 issues of spidey's earlier adventures, going through many important chapters. it doesn't seem to give quite as much satisfaction as the first three volumes, perhaps because most spidey fans have seen reprints of some of the issues contained in this volume. if you're new to spidey, snag this... if you're not new, still get it to fill in your blanks =). lee does it again!	2
catherine coulter lets this story get a bit off course.  when the hero phillip finds and takes care of sabrina for five days because of her illness and the snow storm leaving them trapped in a hunting cabin. during the time in the cabin he is very attentive and ready to protect her after he finds out her brother-in-law attemped to rape her but failed and still planned to do so later.  when philip finally succeeds in getting sabrina to marry him for he compromises her by taking care of her the five days in the hunting cabin.  he later becomes so insensitive to her feelings almost one step from being just like her brother-in-law when he physically hits her.  i thought she went why off character then.  the story redeems itself towards the end.  i love her bride series and the calypso series, but this book left me lacking. interesting but the hero goes off course	2
i am impressed with this book. it's easy to read and understand, and i learned a lot about the importance of magnesium and how it helps us to function.  i have shared this book with friends and family so they can improve their diets and learn how a magnesium deficiency affects their health. my daughter has not had a migraine since she has incorporated this mineral in to her diet.  that in itself made the purchase worthwhile.  highly recommend. educational	1

junie b. jones: kindergartener. she's worrying about having a boyfriend and living &quot;happily ever after&quot; in her strange junie-like world. first of all, her grammar is horrible and is fighting over this poor little 5-year-old boy named warren, who just wants to be left alone. even lucille and grace liked him, and junie b liked him because he was on a t.v. commercial. i'm 9 now, and i think junie b has lost her mind of wanting a boyfriend. then, she begs her mom to go to the mall so she can buy princess clothes to make warren notice him. she made comments like: &quot;and he was beauty to our eyes...&quot; &quot;what a chunk.&quot; and &quot;...i think i'd like him as my new boyfriend.&quot; she said she needed to &quot;move on in her life&quot;, which i thought was silly. ok, so she learned you shouldn't make friends by buying fancy stuff to make him or her like you, but junie b needs to quit thinking about boys and more about her english. the kid's 5...and she says she's &quot;in love&quot;!	0
"i bought this hoping for wise advice on financial matters. i instead found this book to be 200 pages of talk without substance. the points it makes (dont retire, quit work, die broke) are remade over and over in different ways without much of any intelligent argument as to why or how. i felt the book was not worth a read at all and was just a bunch of fluff to make up 200 pages. it was poorly organized as well with different subjects per each chapter. for example chap. 8 is ""accountants"" through chapter 46 is a one page chapter on ""savings accounts."" i couldnt believe how many words were used that never said anything. blah. he talks a lot but doesnt say much"	0
this story of the battle for new orleans is interesting and extremely well written.  it is not one of those deeply detailed scholarly works that drags on and on with details that you are not particularly interested in.  mr. groom quickly lays out the facts of the matter.  what he does best is make the historical figures in his book come alive for the reader. andrew jackson,  no matter what his faults, truly loved the united states and was more than willing, almost eager, to risk his life for his country.  and, at the battle of new orleans, with the future of the united states at risk, a pirate/privateer named jean laffite took the side of andy jackson.  the battle they fought together, alongside the people of new orleans, is amazing.    this briskly written book will tell you about some fantastic and tragically brave people. excellent	1

"i have to say, a lot of people will find this book to appear unbiblical if they do not know their scriptures exceptionally well.  the scriptures do not say, ""the 2nd coming is the final coming"" - otherwise the dispensational millenialists (""left behind"" ideology) would really be in trouble since they have at least 2 returns of christ, the ""hidden"" rapture before the tribulation (book 1 in the left behind series), as well as the ""glorious appearing"" (the final book in the left behind series).    this book is a good example of what theologians (like myself) refer to as ""speculative theology"" - theology based not on what scripture says, but what scripture has not discussed one way or the other.  he asks the question: could christ have an ""intermediate return"" before the ""glorious appearing,"" but nothing like what the ""left behind"" ideology is projecting?  could the current state of israel be about bringing forth this intermediate return, and not the final one?  or could it have nothing to do with the final return?  all these questions are thrown out there for the reader to contemplate and consider.  excellent piece, well worth the money. throught provoking concept"	1
mr.warren seems to have trouble focusing on the subject matter in the first half of this book, making it seem to be merely a digest of fantasy and science fiction. i guess one can enjoy this book if you are open  minded, very open minded. there are however more serious and factual  findings on this subject for the more serious ufo fans. if you must buy the  book, save your cash and buy the paperback. focus	0
i am going to resign from critiquing this book on a literary scale, and just say that i didn't enjoy this book for the same reason a couple others mentioned - its boring and repetitive. maybe its because i'm not used to aimless - albeit eloquent -landscape descriptions, or maybe it's the fact that nothing happens for 264 pages, but reading this book felt more like a chore than an enjoyable reading experience. case in point: casual readers beware. if this is classic nature lit, then maybe its just me...	2

"american academic ido oren started his research by looking at the common idea that democracies do not fight each other. he shows how studies only support this idea because our concept of democracy is produced by the same historical patterns against which the claims are `tested', a history partly shaped by the usa's international rivalries.    so, before world war one, woodrow wilson, the political scientist, described imperial germany as an advanced constitutional state, a model for administrative reform. yet when he became president, woodrow wilson took the usa into war against germany, and described it as an autocracy.    oren looks at american political science as an ideology: its claims to uphold the ideals of liberal democracy, as expressed, for instance, by samuel huntingdon, a past president of the american political science association. yet the apartheid government used huntingdon's writings, as when he backed it against `the worse alternative' of a government led by `the revolutionaries of the anc'. he advised the apartheid government that increased authoritarianism might be necessary for reform, rationalising its repression, and he backed its `centralization of power'. typically, the cia funded some of his research.    oren studies american political science's characterisations of the usa's chief enemies last century, its concomitant characterisations of the usa, and its involvement in the wars against imperial germany, fascist italy, nazi germany and the soviet union. ""i document a systematic pattern of change in the portrayals of these enemies before and after their conflicts with us."" also, he shows the pattern of concurrence between us wars and transformations in political science's visions of the usa. the soviet union was seen as all state, no society, the usa as all society, no state.    he chronicles the growth of intimacy between the political science profession and the state department, especially during the us attack on vietnam. oren asks whether `american political science might be more attached to america's regime than to democracy'. he concludes that it indeed works from the us state, not an objective, perspective. useful study of academic bias"	2

be sure to look for the newer edition (2003) as it covers 70 small towns. i started out thinking i would just dip into this, and read a few pages here and there. then it turned out to be so interesting with florida history, local tidbits, interesting people and architecture, that i read it straight through.   now i can't wait to visit havana to see the antique shops or to see the 36 murals in lake placid.   some of the towns merely have interesting names (yeehaw junction) or a single sight, but many sound worthwhile for a day trip or longer visit. probably should keep this book in the car while in florida and check it occasionally to see if you are near any of these interesting places.   it is arranged by regions (north, central and south). get off the beaten path	1

"when i was first chosen to narrate this book, i knew nothing of the racist past of its author -- i knew only that it was the single worst book i'd ever been assigned.  the negative audiofile magazine review of the recording (quoted here on amazon) is completely fair.  reading the book to myself in order to prepare to record it, i found it annoying in the extreme -- the so-called prose is precious and poorly written, and the allegedly authentic colloquialisms are grating.  when it came time to say it all aloud, for the first time ever (and i've narrated upwards of 200 audiobooks) i found it impossible to invest this piece of literary flotsam with any emotional content whatsoever.  as declining the job was no longer an option, i merely tried to stay out of the way and give it as simple and logical a performance as i could, but i was unable to compensate for the god awful writing, and unable to disguise my contempt for the entire enterprise.  it remains the worst recording i have ever done, and i was, for a time, quite ashamed of it.  now that i discover more about its hate mongering author, i'm actually quite pleased that the recording stinks.  i now believe i gave this garbage exactly the reading it deserved.  (i must add that i learned a valuable lesson: never record a book you loathe.  i was subsequently offered the execrable ""left behind - the kids"" series for young adults, but having suffered through ""little tree,"" knew better than to lend my voice to the spewing of ""christian"" hate. the worst book i've ever recorded..."	0
"this is a very simplistic book and reading it provided me with no knowledge that i didn't already have.  the author could get across every point in the entire book in a five page summary.  he starts by telling us about the broken window theory put forth in 1982 and illustrated a few examples of how it lead to lower crime.  he references both the original atlantic monthly article, as well as ""the tipping point"" (which i highly recommend), and some other texts and speeches that are written much better than his book and that actually contain original and interesting information.    the author explains in very simple language how this theory can be applied to business.  essentially the entire book says that ""broken windows"" in business are the little things that go wrong, and how a business can't afford to let this happen.  he spends almost half of the book talking about how ""people can be the ultimate broken window"" and how customer service is one of the most important aspects of your business.  these concepts are so simple, that they are basically just reiterations of common business sense.     this book does not probe deeply, nor does it even come close to actually delivering any insight or analysis beyond the most superficial.  while his case studies are potentially interesting, he doesn't spend more than two pages on any given one.      this book is only worth reading if you want some simple concepts and rules that you already know listed in a convenient format.  personally, i found that buying and reading this book was a waste of time.  there are plenty of other books about business that contain information and insights that you don't already know. not much value"	2

the book i am going to talk about is the book arms and the man by bernard shaw. i really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand.  the reason i didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. the english was hard to understand. i liked how the writer wrote the book and i would probably look for another one of his books. this book was more like an opera with out music. if i could have and known to i probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. one reason i picked the book was because it was dealing with war and i thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when i got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. if you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story. arms and the man	2
should be titled 'art of selling products, making hundreds by manipulating prospects'. excellent for brokers or insurance agents looking for a quick fix in getting appointments or products sales, but the buzz will wear off.  a big disappointment for fee-based planners or advisors looking to expand  their client base. it deals more with manipulating prospects over the phone  than with practical face-to-face financial services sale. for cold-callers only!	0
i am very proud to be a korean parent because i read this book.  this book explains the suffering of the korean parents all over america.  korean children often do not appreciate all the difficulties their parents had to go through to give them the university of california education.  many korean parents work in harsh conditions and work long hours and experience all kinds of anti-korean insults by whites.  this book explains the pain that korean parents had to go through.  it is difficult to explain all my pain to my children.  it's difficult when they are young because i don't want to burden them.  it's difficult when they are old because it seems petty and they seem to be going through problems of their own.  but korean parents suffer in america as immigrants who work hard to reach middle class.  this book is great because i can just give to my children to read and they can understand my hardships just by reading about it.  i have friends who can't even speak english so they can't communicate to their children about their experiences.  for such a korean parent, this book is ideal.  i recommended this book to them. a proud korean parent	1

this book has absolutely beautiful paintings that compliment the familiar song over the rainbow.  my 5 year old daughter likes it a lot.  her absolute favorite in the series is i live in music by ntozake shange, which is part of this series, and might seem odd for a pre-schooler, but her whole class really responded to it as well. one of a beautiful series	1
"this book should have been called ""beautiful interior designs that happen to include some home theater gear"", or ""home theater style"".  it's little more than a pretty picture book of impressive-looking rooms that integrate ht gear, and often in a laughable way.  the text is fluffy, thowaway stuff that is irritating to read.    the photos are very well done, but often include speakers and other gear set up with no unsightly cables.  of course, without the unsightly cables, there'd be no audio or video, either.  i guess that's the main thing that got to me -- if you're going to show a setup with nice speakers and other gear that are out in the room, at least be honest about how to treat cables and make them look as good as possible.  don't just leave them out altogether.  it's insulting, and is foolish in a book that is supposedly about ht. way too fluffy for my taste"	2

"""envy"" is a hard book to pin down. in a nutshell, we have will moreland, a new york therapist who has elected to go to his college reunion. his wife carole prefers to stay home since she does not know anyone and they are still feeling the emotional tug of the loss of their son, luke. during the reunion, most people are more concerned with the whereabouts of his twin brother mitch, a pretty famous long-distance swimmer, whom will is estranged. after reading about some of his former collegiates, he comes across the bio of former flame elizabeth and discovers that she has a daughter that could possibly be his. when he asks her, she justifiably balks at him.    he returns home, and seeks out a therapist of his own to discuss his intimacy issues with his wife, as well as his dark sexual fantasies, as they are starting to interfere with his effectiveness at his own practice. he is also having problems with the abandonment of his twin, who he has not seen since his wedding day. mitch was born with birthmark that made him stand out to ridicule as a child. will always felt guilt that his own face was not marred. little does he know that the brother that he protected since childhood made a mockery of his devotion, as he slowly learns the truth behind mitch's absence.    a new patient arrives in his office with her own intimacy issues. she is a student and seduces older men. when she relishes in telling him about her sex life in detail, it is evident that her next victim is going to be will. after she makes an inappropriate move on him, he decides to terminate their relationship and refers her elsewhere. soon, she is knocking down his door, insisting that he see her. when she disrobes, will's own lack of willpower triggers a sexual escapade which he will forever wish did not happen, particularly when the patient reveals who she is.     suddenly will questions is own relationship with his wife, former lovers, his brother, and his parents. this really could have been a moving story, but i did not feel a connection in any way to the storyline - there was no real emotion, depth, or character development. the revelation of the student's identity is no surprise - anyone can se that coming. all told in a matter-of-fact manner, with little emotion, the story never has any clear resolution, nor any closure, making it a bit of a disappointment. lacking depth & character development"	2

"first, fix the date in the description amazon!!!!!    in spite of loopy's warning i ordered this book in hopes he had just received old inventory. wrong! i received the same 1995 book and when i complained to amazon they sent me a replacement. another 1995 book. while the information in the book appears good, it's describing conditions over 10 years old which could be a lifetime for a trout stream. the clark fork, for example, is described as ""teetering between two possible futures-magnificence and ruin."" my online research has indicated the clark fork has continued to recover nicely from the heavy metal runoff from the mining but if this book were my only guide i would be skeptical about including it as a destination for my trip.    if this book were up to date i would give it at least 4 stars. but considering the age i would recommend you pass and search for other sources. very outdated!!!"	2
"the text is thoroughly unorganized, it has almost no coherent linear progression. the author often repeats himself, uttering the ""final solution"" of the ""jewish question"" over and over without giving an studied analysis of what that means. the book is a pistache of accusations and anecdotes about people's involvement in the ""final solution"" without offering any studied analysis of any one particular group or person. for example, we are introduced to a commander wohlauf--an office of battalion 101---and his wife. we are told that he killed jews and his pregnant wife watched, but thats about it. the author also infuses his writing with pedantry: rather that presenting the facts as they are, he is compelled to make the reader feel shocked by using exclamation points to drive home how we should feel.   undoubtedly antisemitism was endemic not only in germany, but throughout europe, but one gets the feeling that the author is cherry picking throughout history  to bolster his outlandish thesis that the germans were predicated to mass murder of jews. almost unreadable"	0
you'd better hope you've got a good professor for dynamics, because this book is absolutely no help. it gives proofs for most equations, but doesn't seem to think any amount of example problems are necessary. i have the bootleg copy of the solutions manual for this book and the author solves most of the problems with bizarre calculus that isn't discussed in the chapter at all.    to top it off, the set (statics and dynamics) was $180 at my college bookstore. pool your money with your classmates, buy one copy of each, and xerox the problems. you will not miss anything. useless text	0

"i have been a fan of lois lowry's books for years, and have appreciated some of the other ways she has handled disability before.  that is why i had trouble with how she handled it in this book.    much of my family in the era this book is written lived in rural areas, and many were said to be ""touched"", with the same conditions that cause me, for instance, to be unable to speak or relate to people in the usual way.  they were also accepted in their communities a lot more than i have been in modern urban settings, and none were a danger to their communities.  i enjoyed reading about similar settings to the ones in my family stories.    that is why the ending was so shocking.    there is a stereotype of disability that has caused disabled people to be removed from our families for a long time.  this one runs that we don't know any better, but have sinister tendencies lurking somewhere in our inability to understand certain things.      it makes for a plot device that is accepted by many non-disabled people.  rain man went to an institution and is supposed to stay there his whole life because he ""might hurt the baby"", even though there are ways of preventing that kind of thing without taking such drastic measures, and even though that kind of thing is not common among autistic people.  the boy in this story does something similar, with similar results.    to people unfamiliar with this stereotype, or who believe in it, this plot device may seem powerful, and a way of advancing the sensitivity of the main character who knows that he ""didn't mean to do"" what he did.  to me, it seems like a shortcut.  many people in roughly that era were institutionalized because of widespread prejudices that they would hurt someone, or rape their sisters, or other things that turned out not to be how it usually actually happens.  the story, to me, would have been more powerful by far if it had addressed those kind of real problems, rather than using the hackneyed storyline that is easier to write, perhaps, but advances those very same stereotypes.    i wonder how many readers of this book will do the same sort of thing as one young mother did when she refused to allow me to board at her house because she had a small child and believed i would hurt him because i am autistic.  that is the true danger in ""they're dangerous, but they can't help it.""  i wonder what kind of thing she had heard and read to form a strange opinion like that.    the author is a good author, and from the point of view of someone who might well have had the same social status in that era as the boy did, she could have written him, and even handled the issues around this kind of idea, much more responsibly. why did she have to tell the story that way?"	2
"""when will it end?? never! muwhahahahaha!""    review contains spoilers*****    first off, up until this point, i found the series moderately entertaining (especially the 2nd book). granted, in every book, there are certain aspects of jordan's redundant writing that are very annoying. for instance, the childish, and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters. realistically, in a time period like that, if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series, they would get a good ""thumping"" and be forced to learn from their mistakes (as would anyone really). instead, the men grovel like slaves around the women. it's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic. even in fantasy, there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race. hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational, practical decision. there is hardly any logic here, and when someone who is supposedly ""wise"" speaks up, its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should, and probably does know. most of the so-called ""intellectual"" sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know.    human characteristics aside, jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery (clothing, geography, battle fields etc...) hardly anything is left out. i suppose this is good, if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that jordan has created.     but here we are...at the 5th book. i hate to say it, but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books. sometimes, it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another. jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books. this can either be as an excuse for such a long series, or its just basically poor writing. i'm a little undecided on that.     this book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had:    1. most of the men can't think for themselves (however there are a number of characters that i do like allot. uno, julian, matt, asmodean, lan, thom, loial (who isn't even in this one..go figure) what happened to elays?? uhg..    2. the female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter    3. rand's increase in the one power, is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into. it all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the dragon reborn (end of book 1 i believe). it takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up, and take action. this is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series. rand attains the 'sword that cannot be touched'. a weapon that can level cities...what does he do? shoves it into the floor at the stone of tear, and scampers off into the woods for another adventure. wow..smart huh?     4. the forsaken are scheming as usual. it's a mystery to me that they were picked by the dark one. powerful as they may be, they're mostly stupid, too paranoid, and un-trustworthy of one another. it would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate rand. they could. everyone knows they could. but they don't...frustration level ever increasing...    this series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time. jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time, then shove them off, with hardly a word of goodbye.     something that i must point out is the way jordan decides to kill off, or deal with the ""evil"" characters. this whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance, and fear of death. i believe it is wrong to kill off so many ""evil"" characters at one time. characters that have potential are eliminated.    and yes...asmodean. here comes my biggest gripe of all..  i rather liked asmodean, his character was interesting, and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the ""evil"" side, to ""good"" side (even if it was un-willingly).  he does provide a lot of insight for rand. if i was a forsaken, i would defiantly cross over to rand's side, it only makes sense. but...instead of keeping asmodean alive and allowing him to help rand with his great struggle...he's killed off at the end of the book.     right there, jordan drops a huge amount of story potential, and trades it for the same, un-inventive, one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains. then rand goes on to kill rhavin. another interesting character wasted. lanfear has also been killed (as far as we know). again, another interesting character wasted. i could care less about moraine. after the first book, her character is basically rendered useless, and is completely unneeded.     all in all, jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters (hurin, ingtar, elays etc..) and keep the boring, immature ones. (nynaeve, egwene, elayne, aviendha etc...)     the series is simply too long, and i'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded. if lord of chaos is as bad as this one, i'm burning my collection and sending the remains to jordan's house.     so, to those who are in the midst of this series like i am, i say to you; 'welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends'. welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends..."	2
under western eyes is not a light novel but a deep, refelctive study of the russian intellect and society. this book permitted me to understand what we westerner's often cast of as the &quot;russian personnality&quot; and the complexity of the historical, social and psychological climate of russia and the russians shortly before the bolshevik revolution. this novel does not ressemble any ohter of conrad's as it has a strange feeling or atmosphere to it that can barely be grasped. i read it when i was young and i was deeply affected by the people he describes and the locations. a must for anyone interested or related to the russian nation. a thoughtful novel	2

"rabi maharaj is confused about hinduism, the ""culture-religion"" in which he  was born and raised. except the part that he was  born in a hindu family,  rabi is totally ignorant of the concept of god  in hinduism.       christians worship one & only god in three persons; hindus worship one & only  god in trillions of forms.  fact of the matter is,  this concept of one & only god, started during rig vedic period in india, at least 1000 years before the birth of hebrew civilization in the land of cannon.   the hindu rig veda 1:164:46 states "" ekam sat viprah bahudha vadanti---- ""there is only one god [truth] , but sages call that god many names"".   another ancient hindu scripture yajurveda 32: 2 states   ""na tasya pratima asti"" [there is no image of him]... another hindu scripture  svetasvatara upanishad 4:19  states ""his form is not to be seen; no one sees him with naked eye.""    ravi should  also know that hindus do not  worship  icons but like everybody else use ""icons"" to concentrate on a god who has ""no name or form.""     i have a  question for  rabi and the great apologetic, radio-tv talk show guest  dave hunt.   you  quote thousands of verses from the holy bible, when ever you wanted to talk, preach  and write about christianity.    so my question to you ,  "" why you failed to quote even one verse from a hindu scripture to prove your arguments against hinduism?     in my review, i quoted many verses from the hindu scriptures to prove hindus worship only one god.  why  authors of this book failed to quote not even  one verse from a hindu scripture to prove  their arguments?   how can you ridicule or condemn a culture/ religion like hinduism about 1 billion people on earth practice, with out even quoting one verse from a  hindu scripture?    unless by writing this book their intention was to follow the foot steps of   dr. joseph goebbels, propaganada minister of the third reich  who said , "" repeat a lie thousand times and it becomes the truth."". book condemns hinduism without quoting any hindu scripture.

"yes, there are flaws in kinsey's statistics and sometimes his methods were unethical. these two problems still exist today. but i think this book goes too far. there are no references to back up the ""facts"". it was written by a journalist with no credentials except that she is on a lifetime crusade to repress people's sexuality. it is published by ascension press, a religious publisher. of course it is going to denounce his work. this publisher represents people who live by the bible and kinsey's research does not follow the bible. so why does that make it wrong? i wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with a brain. one sided"	0

the next time someone tells you anti-zionism is not anti-judaism, please cite this book. it is a total and 300 percent proof that the two phenomena are one and the same. in today's climate, israel is the international jew, and hating israel amounts to hating jews and the jewish faith. this book proves this beyond a reasonable doubt, and the fact that it is highly placed on all arab and muslim anti-israel websites is another indication of the same. bosh and balderdash, a great huge piece of trash. anti-zionism is anti-semitism	0

this book, and the glimpse it provides into the lives of these strong  women, gives hope to the catholic church and to the world. it is the women who have challenged the church, called it to task for not being all that it must be, and who have yet remained faithful to the church -- or at least to the call of the spirit -- who are and will be the agents of change that is so deperately needed in our world today. good catholic girls	1
"overall, this book was terrible.    i will start with the few excellent points this book made:    many celebrities have horrendous families (3 kids from 3 different men, for example), but this is overlooked while it is practically the only thing people say about poor women (ex: ""welfare mothers""). the chapter on welfare mothers had lots of good points in it-it was worth reading.     they make the point that parents are too ""child-centered"" now. it is true that some parents let their kids have way too much control and give them way more material goods and attention than they need. kids don't really need much of either. however, what these authors are promoting is extremely opposite of ""child-centered.""     the marketing of products moms ""need"" is out of control. many moms waste money on irrelevant products and really need to be aware of the marketing aimed at them to try to get them to buy tons of junk. you need to be smart about marketing, good point.     but... then.... the authors make a comment like this: ""while it was certainly true that many mothers were looking for toys that were stimulating and compensated for the fact that america still had no national day care or nursery school system, the toy industry always suggested that the new marketing trends were entirely driven by mothers."" that's right, it's the lack of national day care that is causing me to become rampantly materialistic! no matter what the problem, these authors will find someone/something to blame it on.     now, to all the other things that i did not like about this book (where to start!):    the authors go on and on and on about celebrities and how they are portrayed as perfect mothers and workers. give me a break. women have to be smarter than to actually believe this nonsense. please don't blame people for making you feel guilty as a mother. celebrities are not even in the same class as the rest of us. they can't even compare their lives to ours. and, if they try, you must know it is a bunch of baloney. if you don't want to read about celebrity babies, don't buy people. don't watch et. it's really not hard to avoid if it affects you so much.    although the authors think pointing to a few isolated daycare incidents is no evidence of problems with childcare (they vehemently defend daycares, even ones that are investigated for crimes against children), they seem eager to make a point that a few other isolated cases- andrea yates, susan smith, babies in dumpsters- is obviously calling attention to a problem with the new ""momism."" this is the scapegoat for these women who killed their children. no matter what your parenting problem, the authors have an excuse for you!      ""dumb men, stupid choices- or why we have no childcare:"" the authors open with a description of a wwii daycare center. the few that were actually like this were open 24 hours and did your laundry and grocery shopping while you worked, along with meal prep, and taking care of sick children in a special place in the center (which were no doubt this nice because they were a temporary solution for women called from home to do their civic duty). the authors are saying this is what it should be like today......     so then the authors go on to bash everyone who doesn't agree with their childcare position. then they bring out this stat: ""by 1995, 75 percent of kids under five were regularly watched by someone other than their parents."" they are implying that 75% of women out there need/want government daycare centers. first of all, that statistic is ridiculous. the 75% stat includes part-time moms (which are about ½ of the 75%). some of these moms work very few hours, other do ""split shifts"" with their spouse so their children don't have to go to daycare. many part-time kids are playing with grandma or auntie and cousins. i really doubt these kids would rather be in big, govt. daycare. now, of the roughly 37% of moms working full-time, the percentage that have to work to make ends meet is very small. if you also look at the preferences of poor women who have to work, they overwhelmingly like home based and relative care for their children-not huge govt. daycare. they also overwhelmingly, if given a choice, would rather stay home and raise their own children. so, the authors of this book are pushing for a childcare system, of enormous cost, that is the least popular option and will serve a minority of working mothers.     then this comment, ""many young mothers who need a salary-and, frankly, time away from the kids-feel they have no choice but to quit their jobs, either for the sake of the kids, or because they simply can't afford the childcare near them."" are these authors suggesting that the taxpayers pick up the bill for moms who want to get out of the house and work for fun? it sure sounds like it!     the authors act like there are no honest women out there who enjoy motherhood. the authors are clearly blinded by their own feelings. i'm really not sure why women like these authors feel a calling to publish books trying to convince the public that happy, fulfilled mothers are a ""myth."" it's not.    in the chapter: ""dr. laura's neighborhood"" (and in the rest of this book) we learn that if you are a: man, home-schooling mom (except a few minority who the authors think are ok), attachment parenting mom, christian, conservative, someone who likes organically grown food, happy mother, a member of the ""greatest generation,"" someone who likes decorating, pro-life, breastfeeding mom, mother of multiple babies (they especially like to attack you if you used fertility drugs) or a sahm-you are not approved by these authors!     these authors are pompous and arrogant, thinking they are the be-all-end-all to judge others. these women are clearly driven by some irrational rage against all other mothers who are not exactly like them. the women who wrote this book are the type that will sneer at you in traget because your child is crying or having a tantrum. they are the types who would turn the other way and let the door slam in your face when you are trying to get your stroller out an non-automatic door. and watch out if you are on their ""most hated"" list because you would get the extra-extra dirty look. this book reads like a nasty note you would find on the floor of a high school, written by a girl who is jealous of the girls in another clique. overall, a terrible book with a horrible attitude "	0
"read this to understand sting's ""tea in the sahara"" reference for the first time, and to your very core.  (we're all looking for the tallest sand dune--the place with the optimal vantage point--and we often lose our way in deserts of our own making.)  what an amazing book.  i'm so glad i believed gore vidal's cover blurb about bowles' art far exceeding that of other contemporary american writers.  really, vidal says it best: ""bowles has glimpsed what lies back of our sheltering sky...an endless flux of stars so like those atoms which make us up that we experience not only horror but likeness.""  beg, borrow, or buy at least a cheap paperback version: if you don't read the sheltering sky, you're missing out on greatness. often overlooked masterpiece"	1
"i've lived in china since 1999, and i often read stories about  china in the western media that i simply don't believe. others  report on abuses that do occur here without giving a reader any  understanding of why. so, china remains ""inscrutable."" (i'm  rolling my eyes...)    china is a complex subject. how can a westerner who has never  been here know what's happening? china is so far away and  shrouded in a bit of mystery, some due to the sheer length of  its history and some due to the power of the party. in my  case, i don't speak chinese, so getting past the public face is  impossible.    ian johnson of the wall street journal won a pulitzer prize for  his reporting on china. he speaks the language. and, he's one  heck of a fine journalist. in wild grass, he recounts the  stories of three ordinary chinese citizens who find themselves  fighting the repression of the system, risking imprisonment  and even death.    johnson understands ""the big picture,"" and after reading this  book, so will you. a nation is not just a single entity. it's  made of people. all nations, not just the one you live in. so  what are the people in china like? read this book, and you'll  feel like you've met some of them. a peasant lawyer, a young  architectural student, a bereaved daughter. poor farmers in  yulin and party officials in beijing.    johnson also brings the scenery to life, makes the unfamiliar  familiar, and captures many little details and episodes and  ironies. a compelling subject in the hands of a masterful  author.    china is experiencing unprecented economic development. what  effect will this ultimately have on its social and political  system? i don't agree with all of the author's conclusions --  it surprises me how much i agree with the party -- but it  doesn't matter. that's part of the beauty of this book. to  bandy about phrases like ""evil empire"" is the simplistic  idiocy that will (i hope) eventually doom morons like dubya.  can we please move past that and try to genuinely understand?    there can be no doubt that what johnson reports in this book  is factually accurate. if you want to learn about china, this  is a good place to start. and then, form your own conclusions.  there's plenty of room for you to do that here. which, in the  end, is what journalism is all about.    i'm quite glad that i read this book. this is literature, same  as george orwell, who i also don't always agree with. and  agreement does not matter. spurring a reader to think is what  matters. johnson can do that with the best of them. an excellent book about my homeland"	1
"in ""the masculine marine: homoeroticism in the u.s. marine corps,"" author steven zeeland offers a compelling alternate view of one of the united states' most revered and recognizable institutions.  an ""about the author"" note identifies zeeland as a research associate at the center for research and education in sexuality at san francisco state university.  the heart of the book is a series of revealing interviews that zeeland conducted with several marines.  his interviewees include both gay and straight men, and one woman marine; he also includes both officers and enlisted men.  particularly interesting is an interview with a gay black navy officer who previously had been an enlisted marine and who, at the time of the interview, was involved in an interracial relationship with a marine corporal.    among the many themes covered in the book are marine tattoos, the ""gays-in-the-shower"" issue, marine attitudes about physical fitness and body image, the role of women marines in the corps, boot camp experiences, the ""selling"" of the corps through advertising, gay relationships, the ""coming out"" experience, defining masculinity, and the parallel between marine self-presentation and that of drag queens.  a particularly important theme is the unique reputation and mystique of the corps; in his introduction, zeeland notes that ""marineness is like a religion.""  specific male-on-male sex practices engaged in by marines are frankly discussed and provocatively analyzed. the book also looks at homoerotic rituals and language of the corps.  the historical backdrop for the book includes the gulf war, u.s. intervention in somalia, and the beginning of the clinton presidency.    the consistently compelling text is complemented by a sixteen-page visual section which explores marine tattoos, haircuts, physiques, and dress.  there are photographs from the athletic model guild and other sources.  a particularly interesting part of the visual supplement is a 12-panel comic by jerry mills entitled ""poppers""; this ironic, richly detailed piece is essentially a complete short story in comic form.    the book is full of fascinating anecdotes and observations, both from zeeland and his interviewees.  although zeeland is doing a serious scholarly project, complete with end notes, he makes no pretense at scholarly detachment.  he notes in his prologue that his research technique involves befriending servicemen--""sometimes in an intimate way.""  he is sort of like an extreme jane goodall, passionately connected to the objects of his study.  at times his writing and interview questions struck me as too self-indulgent, but in the end he has produced a human document that is both informative and profoundly moving.  the book interrogates iconography, challenges stereotypes, and gives gay marines a space to tell their first-person stories.  for a companion text, i recommend ""generation kill,"" an account of marines in the iraq war written by embedded reporter evan wright.  wright documents some startling examples of marine homoeroticism; he even quotes one marine as saying, ""man, the marines are so homoerotic.  that's all we talk about.""  like wright, zeeland has produced a truly remarkable contribution to marine corps literature. an illuminating peek inside the corps' ""closet"""	1

"the best part about this book was the intro.  in fact all you need to understand what the late mr. bloom was trying to put forth is in the introduction.    the rest of the book is  a chore to read.  the confusing and tedious writing  style leads to a lot of re-reading of sentences to figure out the point the author is trying to make.  someone should have counseled mr. bloom that ""brevity is the soul of wit."". nice intro..."	2

this installment, like the rest of this series so far, is suspenseful, funny and populated with characters that seem very real.  one new character, laura fielding, is admirably faithful to her imprisoned husband, and is, in general, a very likable character (and one that charms both stephen and jack).  the middle eastern setting of this book is exotic and very vividly described.  stephen's adventures in his new scientific marvel, the diving bell, are both funny and interesting.  jack's encounters with laura's massive dog ponto are hilarious.  the end of this book is very suspenseful because the reader has come to really care about the characters involved.  the most notable thing about this book is what a great job o'brian did of keeping this series fresh by bringing in new locations, characters and situations.  o'brian did a great job of not letting this series fall into predictable formulas and repetition.  the only failing of this book is that the very end is just a little disappointing and o'brian leaves the reader hanging much more than in the previous books. one of the most entertaining books in the series so far	1
i had purchased this workbook intending to use it to help study for the pmp exam.  although the workbook does contain over 300 pages of sample  questions that might be helpful in studying for the exam, it does not  include answers to any of the questions.  therefore, there is no way to  verify that you've answered the questions correctly, which made the  workbook of very little value to me.  i decided to return it to amazon  unused. caution when ordering this workbook!	0
this novel was difficult for me to get into.  the noir speak of the book presented itself as a barrier to entry.  after training myself to think in terms of the language, i found myself so engrossed in the story that i moved through it at a steady pace.  definitely a darker novel but the character development was outstanding. not an easy read, but worth it	2
this book is heavy on jargon and vendor provided information - it is essentially a collection of articles from computer telephony magazine, without much editing or organization.  it lacks technical depth and is poorly organized for researching information, e.g., its index is essentially a word occurance listing. not technical enough	2
what do we think and believe about ourselves, our place in the world, and the world around us? we have the beliefs, they influence us in more ways every day than we probably realize, but rarely take a look at what they really are. this book is an exploration into the mythology of individuals, complete with exercises and methodologies. if you really want to know and are ready to look, and as a result change and free yourself from old unconscious beliefs, this book might well be a great place to start. changing the story of our lives	1
i lent this book to my mil before i read it but told her not to tell me about it or her thoughts on it until after i read it. i couldn't get passed the 2nd chapter. i found myself skipping pages that soon. i asked her if she liked it and she said she skipped a lot of pages also and found it to be very repetitive and boring. in my honest opinion it is one of the most boring books i have picked up. it just reads boring!. boring!	0
when i was growing up, my mother told me that she had been given this book by a beau, had read it and enjoyed it. this was in the early 1900s! when i saw it in a used book store about a year ago, i picked it up. i am just now  reading it. i was totally surprised to find that it is beautifully written, presents a wonderful picture of a vanished time and people and is funny. i find myself smiling at the phrases that have become cliches - &quot;when you call me that smile.&quot; and at the fact that i am getting as much pleasure from reading it as my mother did all those years ago. a real classic	1
first, the content is not well-organized.  tv programs and tv memories are generational, so it doesn't make sense to mix images from the 50s-90s together.      second, the photographs have little impact.  the book itself is rather small, and some pages contain clusters of small photos that compete for your attention.    third, there is little interesting commentary.  a good nostalgia book should describe how pop culture and society influenced each other.    this little book doesn't begin to do justice to the most powerful medium of our age. i bought this book used for $1.50 and regret it	0
i'm usually dismissive of most die zauberflotes because i find the overall quality of the singers and recording lacking.  then i came upon this recording...i have to say that it is simply the most amazing die zauberflote i've ever heard!  the orchestrations to the singers to the conductor himself...everything is mind-blowing!  i'm not a mozart person, but if i really like a recording of his i will buy it.  this is an excellent way to introduce yourself to the flute, especially since there is such a wonderful introduction accompanying this extremely famous opera.  and the queen of the night-edda moser!!!  amazing!  simply amazing!  no other queen has conveyed that much drama into her singing.  this is the flute.  i would suggest marriner's version if i hadn't seen this one, but then here is a flute with all the greats in it!  get it now. the definitive magic flute	1
i really enjoy using this book.  my 29 year old gelding has found new vigor from the suggested herbs, and my son's 2 year old mare is in peak condition thanks to black oil sunflower seeds and other recommendations.  i recommend this book to anyone with horses who's interested in helping them to stay happy and healthy into old age. a wonderful reference	1
it looks cute (like martha stewart's magazines) but did not contain one usefull piece of advice.  since most of us only do this once, there is not too much personal experience to draw from.  therefore we look to the professionals for ideas, sample wording and help.    this was total waste of time unless i was going to have each invitation hand written or tied with a rhinestone buckle. pretty but useless	0

this was a great addition to the series. i love the way anne bishop writes i could read her books over and over. the book had a great blend of humor and suspense. i wanted more storyline on some of the characters but the book seemed to drop them. ari was not in this book much which was too bad, i like her character. the book left an opening for another book or a spinoff. if there is no plan to write another book i will be disappointed because there are some characters i would like to follow up on. great book	1
"by reading this book i began to admire bobby jones, not so much for his golf but for his character and his strength in making it to the end.  it would have been a lot easier for him in a folklore sense if he had died young instead of being tortured with a crippling, painful disease that challenged him physically and was a test to him mentally and emotionally.  i admire that he never hid himself away like so many famous people do that want to be remembered as they ""were"".  i believe that this is the most admirable thing about him.  that and his willingness to serve in wwii, landing on the same beach the day after d-day.  not just a ""for show"" tour of duty.  his devotion to his family, his country and his friends and his hometown are quite amazing.  he is a role model in many ways that i don't even think of golf as one of them but for his tenaciousness, his intellect, his well roundedness and his extreme graciousness.  he could have derailed many times but he never did in life.  it's a loss that there isn't more to read about his life to know how he managed to adjust to everyday life and his illness, how he kept putting one foot in front of the other.  the criticism seems unjust re: chick evans, jones was very kind in all his correspondence to him which i have read in other books.  also, so much is made of his temper which he defends and explains in ""down the fairway"" by jones, as not worse than any other player of the time and shortlived as a childish display that was never witnessed again at least publically for the rest of his life.  bobby jones accomplished an amazing number of feats that most of us would feel proud to do even one of such as the many languages he spoke, the degrees, his many intellectual skills, a good family man and most of all his grace in a life. a cherished read"	1
"this is a fun little book chock full of wise sayings gleaned from episodes of the original star trek.  the original was not a space opera, it was a futurized series of life's lessons, very carefully crafted.  each episode had a heavy-duty message embedded within--and not very hard to spot either.  this book does not necessarily include these thematic messages, but it does excerpt a number of pithy, humorous quotes from the characters.  it is highly reminiscent of a poster my dentist has in his office of everything i need to know i learned in kindergarten.  i expect there is also a book with that name, but i haven't read it.  these words of wisdom also remind me of dr. akin's famous ""laws of spacecraft design"" which you can access on the internet.  with his permission, i used several in my book ""the knowledge management and information technology encyclopedia"" (published by the government and not for sale).  my favorite submits from marinaccio's delightful book are:      gossip is often confused with conversation.  in fact it often takes the place of conversation.  take gossip away from some folks and they would turn into mimes.  p.61    when everyone is responsible, ultimately no one is responsible.  p.52    idiot-proofing is also genius-proofing. p.94    great people talk about ideas.  average people talk about things.  small people talk about people.  p.61    attitude is the top priority; after attitude, talent or gifts are important.  p.64    as yogi berra, the great yankees catcher, once said, ""you can observe a lot, just by watching.""  p.23    a person who understands a rule knows when to break it.  p.50    competent people know which rules to follow and which to ignore ... when people of good judgement are allowed to exercise their insights, good results usually follow.  when people=s hands are tied, they are ineffective.  p.94    the more complex the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play.  pp. 8, 53, & 54    difficult choices expose how we truly feel.  what we believe deep inside.  p.39    the most important time to help someone is when they need it.  p.8    for man, utopia is endless challenge.  p.1. words of wisdom from tv?  amazing!"	2

very, very interesting. i found this book by way of another pet communicator who, after doing a reading on my pets, recommended this book. i can't say i learned how to communicate telepathically with my pets,  but... hmmm... what penelope smith says makes sense: quiet mind is the  first step for so many other things, from good health to artistic creation  to, yes, it certainly seems possible, telepathically communicating with  animals. the trouble is, sorting out the junk from genuine communication.  so, in all, so far, i haven't gotten all that much from this book. but i'm  very glad penelope smith wrote it. i know i will come back and re-read it. kind of neat...	2
i've read many titles on lincoln and have come to know the man, his words and his deeds. but now i can say that i understand him. american revisionists have lately found it fashionable and all too easy to knock  down our heroes and charge them with crimes from the perspective of the   twentieth century. yet, boritt's insights are a wonderful celebration of a  true american hero. and better yet, boritt makes no apologies for it.   perhaps we needed to wait for this foreign born author to remind us what  has been really important about the usa all along. wrap yourself in the   red, white and blue and feel patriotic again. oh, and by the way, don't let  the title scare you. the book is quite an easy read. don't just know lincoln, understand him.	1

"i've read lots of pregnancy books, and this book came recommended as an ""honest"" view.  it may be honest, but very negative!  i realize that motherhood isn't usually the fairytale many of us hope it will be, but this book just dwelled on the negatives: sometimes you can't figure out breastfeeding, sometimes you worry that your husband might leave you, sometimes the baby won't stop crying....  hopefully there are more books out there that are more evenly balanced with ""real life"" stories.  i recommend that you keep looking. a rather negative look at motherhood"	2
i bought this book for ideas and best practices. i work in retail design. the quality of the printing of the book was not very good; photos didn't give much of a sense of scale, materials used. and the examples seemed very dated to me.    if you are a retail design professional, you are better off heading to a local mall, taking some notes and pics yourself. dated, not much good info	2
first of all, i'm not jeannine; i'm her husband-she bought the book for me.   i have been wanting to build a guitar (and bass) for a very long time, and have been gathering information from a variety of sources. but this book covers it all as far as construction goes, and its not too bad on the finishing side of things. it covers 3 different types of neck construction, and flat top and carved top bodys. definately money well spent. one of the best!	1
brad warner is truly an inspiring young man.  i have read his book, recommend it to others; met him, recommend him to others, and wonder how long the cobwebs will remain in american zendos with this book flying around. zen is a lived and envolving experience.  warner shows us how we can take a culture and integrate it with another, finding value in each, yet creating a new culture in the process.  zen is icoloclastic reverence.  on the floor are pieces of the trappings of zen.  the zen remain and is vibrant as a result.    the best recommendation? my daughter, the ph.d. scientist, loved it.  so daiho-rosh. american zen begins	1
i am so grateful for this book and to barbara feldon to write it for us.   it prepared me for the holidays and how to plan for them so i could get through them. i am thankful that she helped me avoid pitfalls during vacations. and her clear and simple direction about designing my financial independence put me on the right track. her wonderful hints how to have nice highlights with people with whom we interact all the time is making my daily life filled with kindness and friendly smiles. i still refer to her book all the time when i need to remind myself to be kind to myself and when the solo life gets rough sometimes. it is a must-have. invaluable	1
"for an student or practitioner of adverstising and marketing, this is a ""must read"" and a personal library staple. yes, the examples may be dated, but the concepts are still operable. you should read their ""positioning: the battle for your mind"" first. though based on von clauswitz (set piece warfare), there is much to be learned. include sun tzu the art of war in your library as well.    not that i have an opinion. one of the marketing classics!"	1
walter e. williams is extremely gifted in his ability to present an argument.  in more liberty means less government, williams presents short articles that he has written (ranging from 1995 - 1997), each of these articles is a beautifully orchestrated example of the perfect argument from start to finish.  not only does williams present a convincing argument for each topic, but he adjusts his balance of pathos, ethos, and logos depending on the topic he asses.  when discussing many potentially controversial topics such as school vouchers or education reform, williams first seeks to establish himself as a credible source on the topic, and frequently brings in more than one real life source on the topic.  william's doesn't just quote some professor's work on education, he refers to the owner of a small private school in his area and her opinion on how to solve the problem of our dismal education schools.  due to his brilliance of mind and communication, williams is incredibly effective in presenting his political agenda, and creates a masterpiece in more liberty means less government. excellent arguments from a brilliant writer	1
this is one of those books that every beginner needs. it starts with the simplest characters with the least amount of strokes and builds on those simple characters to more complex ones. i like the book. i'm an abc and i find it a useful reference as i am beginning to learn and add more characters to my database.    in reference to the other review which is warning people to steer clear of this book; traditional chinese is very useful to know. it is after all the original language that is closest to medieval chinese and is the writing which all simplified chinese writing is based. although, hong kong and taiwan will be switching over to the simplified forms of writing in the next few years, i don't believe that means traditional characters will disappear. very useful reference.	2

"""blind alley"" is the fifth novel in the continuing story of eve duncan, forensic sculptor, joe quinn, atlanta police detective and jane macguire, their precocious seventeen year old adopted daughter rescued from the streets. be warned that much of this review might be construed as spoilers but i'm betting that it's not going to matter much since you'll likely be giving the book a pass anyway!     i used to treat iris johansen as a sure thing! you know what i mean - the kind of author whose new title you'd add to your reading list without even caring what the plot line was or you'd pick up a copy at the store without even bothering to flip open the dust jacket for a peek! ""blind alley"" buried that thought - cold, deep and fast! it was a great deal more than just bad - it was truly painful!     a shadowy serial killer named aldo is on the loose slaughtering women in a most unseemly, gruesome fashion. carving their living faces right off their skulls, aldo imagines himself responsible for the systematic elimination of all women who resemble cira, a courtesan/actress/prostitute killed two thousand years ago in the town of herculaneum when vesuvius erupted. it would seem that aldo is a little upset at having lost the love and attention of his father, an archeologist who became obsessed with cira when he discovered her statue and some details of her life.     as if that isn't deep enough in left field as the premise for a thriller, imagine the eyebrows you'll raise when you read that jane macguire, eve duncan and joe quinn's adopted 17 year old daughter is a ringer for cira. not only does she find herself stalked by aldo but some inexplicable psychological attachment to cira plagues jane with regular nightmares in which she is trapped in caves or tunnels fleeing for her life from the eruption of vesuvius.     it doesn't end there - johansen tosses mark trevor into the mix. he's a con and an antiquities smuggler (picture lovejoy with a nasty streak!) who had a run-in with aldo and is intent on killing him. to that end he intrudes himself into eve duncan's and joe quinn's life and sets himself up as jane's protector. now, i'm no prude but the scene in which trevor, a grown man at least as old as joe, has a near sexual encounter with jane, a typical seventeen year old teenager with respect to her hormones and sexuality, is just plain distasteful and, frankly, scored well into the red zone on the ""yuk"" meter!     there is just so much wrong with this novel, it's difficult to know where to begin and where to stop - nightmares that start, happen and end with no explanation or psychological development at all; unlike any previous johansen novel i've read, the characters and dialogue seem trite, wooden and completely contrived; the outcome of mark trevor as a character is left spectacularly un-resolved; eve duncan's obsession with her murdered daughter, bonnie, continues unabated and is definitely becoming downright irritating; a wonderful sub-plot concerning eve's forensic reconstruction of a real skull from the vesuvius eruption was simply deep-sixed!     i still own a few johansen titles that i haven't read so there is perhaps hope. but she'll have to prove to me that she hasn't jumped the shark before i'll spend another cent on a new title!     paul weiss. this does more than just hurt! it's truly painful!"	0
"i don't understand why this book has the ratings of the other reviews here. it is a big disappointment. while this book has some interesting tips between the lines (that's why i give it 2 stars instead of one), it is merely a rambling of a self-important producer. the 303 ""solutions"" are at best 303 anecdotal stories. take solution #96 ""how to shoot in a boat"" for example, it reads, in its entirety ""i always seem to get the jobs of shooting from some kind of moving vehicle. you've read my exploits in the air and on the ground, but what about in the water? shooting footage from a boat is a skill that someday i will master. not wanting to delve into jet skis, ski-dos, or speedboats, i will be discussing motorboats and sailboats."" great solution chuck! that really makes my filming much better. perhaps it would be possible to cut down this book into 99 tips and solutions, but in the style its been written it would still be painful to read and extract useful information. furthermore, the cover says, ""solve any video or edit problem in 10 minutes or less"". not only is that untrue but also shows how silly this book is. the picture of a consumer dv camera also has nothing to do with the content, because chuck uses big professional equipment throughout this book, stuff that takes more than 10 minutes to just unpack by the way. i haven't found a good book to suggest as an alternative yet, but don't waste your money on this one. try any other. self-important"	2

i purhcased this book because i am intersted in world religions, especially those with elements of mysticism.  i have often heard references to the kabbalah and i wanted to learn more about its contents.  i am a college student majoring in biology, psychology, and history, and my desire to study the kabbalah stems not from required coursework but rather from personal interest.    if i were pursuing a degree in religious studies, or had i been repeatedly exposed to the concepts that scholem discussed, i would have been fine.  however, it is nearly impossible for a layman to understand the subject matter as presented by scholem.  there is simply too much jargon and scholem's writing style makes me wonder as if he tried to make things overly complex to divulge his brilliance.      if you are an experienced religious scholar, most likely this book will be excellent.  however, if you're a layman who is attempting to get a feel for the basic concepts and principles of jewish mysticism, this book will only frustrate you because it's too advanced. too complex	2
"alot of reviews are saying the edgar rice burroughs did not actually write ""john carter and the giant of mars"".  the truth is that he did.  this is what happened and what causes confusion: a childrens publisher wanted a short version of a edgar rice burroughs' novel.  mr. burroughs was concerned that he could not keep it short enough for the publisher so he asked his son to help craft a shorter story.  at the same time, amazing stories asked edgar rice burroughs for another mars novel.  a full lenght one to serialize.  edgar took the short story and stretched it to a full novel.  this is confirmed by several sources and by edgar rice burroughs estate.  it explains why some of the novel strays from the rest of the series.  so, yes his son was involved, but it is wrong to say that edgar rice burroughs did not write it. he did.  especially the novel version.    anyway, all of the mars books are exciting and i recomend all the books in the series. the truth"	1

"ivan turgenev's novel ""fathers and sons"" examines the emerging generation gap that reflects the growing changes in 19th century russian society. when the novel begins middle-aged widower nikolai petrovich kirasnov is waiting for the return of his son arkady. arkady, who has just graduated from university, returns with his close friend the nihilist, medical student bazarov. bazarov is the son of a retired army doctor, and he comes from a humble, yet vital background. while bazarov embodies the ideals of nihilism, arkady's belief system seems to be a pale reflection of his friend's. arkady's foppish effete uncle, pavel, a former army officer, is deeply disturbed by bazarov, and sees bazarov and his belief system as a personal affront.     the novel begins in 1859--right before the emancipation of the serfs in 1861--and a significant shift is taking place in russian society. the relatively enlightened kirasnov has freed his serfs, and he's attempting to adjust to employing people who can produce. the management of his estate, however, is problematic. kirasnov has an illegitimate child with a peasant girl he refuses to marry because of the differences in their social status, and the girl, fenichka and her child live in one of the back rooms of the house. fenichka's role is a peculiar one--she's obviously kirasnov's mistress, but she's also a servant within the household.     kirasnov and his brother pavel are ""men of the old school""--whereas bazarov and to a lesser degree arkady represent the new wave of thought--nihilism. bazarov ""does not look up to any authorities ... does not accept a single principle on faith, no matter how highly that principle may be esteemed."" both bazarov and arkady find their nihilist beliefs under assault when they fall in love. bazarov, who believes that the ""study of personalities is a waste of time"" and that ""all people are alike"" finds himself inexplicably falling in love with the elegant, cold, elusive widow anna odintsova. while anna is immensely attracted to bazarov, she cannot allow herself to engage in any passionate affair. he threatens her passionless, ordered world, and she threatens his nihilist beliefs. but falling in love is just the first of bazarov's problems. he also discovers that prolonged exposure to the kirasnov family is a contaminating influence, and he tells arkady, ""that's what comes of living with feudal lords. you'll become a feudal lord yourself, before you know it, and take part in knightly tournaments.""     bazarov is a marvelous, strange and unforgettable character, and ""fathers and sons""--one of the seminal novels from the period--is a must for russophiles. as a companion piece, i recommend ""nihilist girl"" by sofya kovalevskaya--displacedhuma. ""i've already told you that i believe in nothing."""	1
i received a promotional copy in the mail, and i thank the author for that, since i didn't waste any money on it.    this is a truly unoriginal book. after reading the first few pages, i could see where it was going. i scribbled a few ideas on a piece of paper and started flipping forward through the book. sure enough, he hit every one, and not much else.     this is another rehashing of every rah-rah book you've read on sales, and there are many hundreds of them. i've read several dozen of them, and they all sound the same after a while. the real problem with a book like this is that there might actually be something new in here, but i'd never want to spend the time reading to find it.    typical sections:  you gotta...visualize success  you gotta...think like a winner  you gotta...sell yourself  you gotta...go the extra mile  you gotta...use the power of numbers    you gotta...do better than this to sell this book. same rah rah stuff	0

there's possibly 20 pages of useful information in this book. maybe 15 interesting one. circuit-bending	2
i purchased this book because i was interested in getting into circuit bending to create my own new instruments to use in tandem with our laptop-driven experimental music project.  this book is great, even if you're not already an electronics geek.  very simple and direct.  also, reed ghazala has a totally appreciable geeky sense of humour.  i was laughing out loud as i was learning.  i recommend this book strongly to anyone interested in getting into circuit bending. great book for a beginning bender!	1
this book could quite possibly be the most poorly-written book that i have ever read.  the most glaring flaw is that the last approximately 40 pages are completely irrelevant compared with the rest of the book.  since the book is only 200 pages long, this is quite a tangent for the author to take.  within this section, the narrator descends into a self-pitying diary of his early adult years.  i would like to point out that the plot of the book originally centered around his last year of high school.  past this, the rest of the book suffers from a lack of development.  many new characters and conflicts are introduced, only to disappear in the next chapter.  the main character never develops, and the reader does not have the ability to empathize with his internal struggles.  the book simply does not have redeeming qualities, and even takes a few moments to trash ayn rand; since this is a book that young adults will probably read, it prevents them from forming and informed opinion about that author, controversial as she is.  i was surprised and disappointed that this book was nominated for the pen/faulkner award.  i strongly suggest that inquisitive readers look elsewhere for even mediocre reading material.  0 stars. simply awful	0
i bought this book based on the reviews i had seen on amazon. i was hoping that it would be a book that was chock full of ideas for my kindergarten classroom. i have gotten a few ideas, but it seemed to really focus more on grades 2-3. a good book for all grade levels	2

"dr. alex delaware is invited to take a job on the island of aruk, by the mysterious dr.moreland. shortly into his assigned tasks, alex discovers some very odd cases that the mysterious dr. has treated in the past. one of these cases was a man who claims to have seen ""worm people"". as dr. delaware tries to unravel these mysterious cases, a brutal murder occurs on the island of aruk. alex inquires of dr. moreland about the islands history, and dr. moreland is very vague in his response. as the climax of this novel approaches, alex finds cryptic messages left for him by the then missing dr. moreland.  robin is very much a main character in this story. however, if you are a big fan of milo (as i am ), you may be dissapointed because his character plays a minor part in this novel. i give this story 4 stars, because it is not one of my favorite kellerman stories. i thought the ending was a little silly. very mysterious!"	2
this book, which is basically the memoirs of a young german soldier fighting in russia during wwii, was tragic but fascinating. the language that young willy reese is beautiful and gripping. the young man who wrote this, in other words, was a prolific writer. he used captivating language and an unbridled vocabulary. his metaphors and allusions where breath taking and you never got bored from the raw detail that he used to describe the horrors of war. and with this book you also gain an unparalleled account of the horror and wickedness of fighting in the eastern front. i would recommend this book if you like wwii history or if you like to read a pseudo-prose poem and memoir with outstanding and fantastic language. tragic but fascinating	1
"randi does a good job exposing geller. the only problem is that sometimes randi doesn't go all the way and reveal the magic trick for fear of giving away magician's secrets. this book is out of print, since no one pays attention to geller anymore (partly due to randi's efforts).    having said that, i would also like to point out that randi isn't always fair in his tests of psychics. i'm not endorsing psychics mind you, i just think randi should give credit when it's due. for instance, when randi was on the ""ron and ron"" radio show on wynf in 1995(?), he asked psychic gary spivey what he would be doing on wed. night. spivey correctly guessed randi would be flying on an airplane, to which randi, who was obviously flustered, spat and sputtered and finally said ""well, anyone could have guessed that!"" later, host ron bennington pointed out, if ""anyone"" could have guessed, why did randi ask it in the first place? randi should have just laughed it off and said ""ok, let's see you do that again!""     so, how do i know randi is right about geller? when faced with the alternative of uri geller being given psychic powers by aliens or using magic tricks, i would take magic tricks as an eplanation. very good expose"	2
for those who enjoy the challenge of reading high theory but are put off by the dry, abstract, pretentious ramblings that more often than not constitute theoretical writing, zizek is the theorist for you.  is there another theorist alive who can on one page explicate the finer points of lacan, hegel and kant, while on the next page tie it all in with the three most popular female pubic hair styles, homosexual ; and subtle distinctions among toilet designs in germany, france, and the united states?  perhaps. but zizek makes these seemingly awkward transitions and uncommon examples quite smoothly; the outrageous examples aren't forced, nor are they merely for &quot;shock&quot; value.  in short, they work to clarify the difficult concepts he is discussing.  although zizek is not what i'd call an easy read - not by a long shot - he certainly knows how to make a challenge a bit less stressful and - gasp! - fun.  en. reading theory isn't supposed to be this fun, is it?	1
"i don't see how you can isolate ""the grand inquisitor"" chapter from the novel in which it is situated, the brothers karamazov.  i think that knowing who is telling the story, who he is telling the story too, what the story means to each of these people, and what the consequences of what the grand inquisitor have to say, are all important; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor!!!!!!!  my suggestion: buy the brothers karamazov instead of this.  it's excellent. yes, read the whole thing!"	2
i made several recepes from this book some time ago, i cant wait to but another book, i just love nigella and her books, they are facinating!! and so entertaining. i love nigella	2
when eleven-year-old art mumby finds out that a visitor is arriving at his run-down home, larklight, which floats in space beyond the moon, he hardly expects to be thrust into a frightening adventure of pirates, plates, and a millenium-long conflict upon which the fate of the solar system rests.  he tells the story of this adventure in larklight (occasionally giving his older sister, myrtle, a chance to narrate via her diary), and the story is nothing if not fantastic.    philip reeve (author of the hungry city chronicles) has created another fascinating world in larklight.  art lives in the victorian society of the 1800's--or rather, what victorian society would have looked like if they'd developed space travel, and astronomy worked according to early speculations about aether (an air-like substance in space that people   can move and breathe in), and interplanetary beings (venus, mars, and the moons of jupiter are all home to a variety of life forms).  reeve cuts no corners, painting the cities and citizens of the solar system in dazzling detail.  the setting is a gorgeous mix of fantasy and science fiction, and fans of both genres will find much to enjoy.    if the world wasn't exciting enough on its own, the adventure is of the edge-of-your-seat variety.  art and myrtle tumble from one tense situation to another with alarming frequency.  most chapters end on cliffhangers, so be prepared to have trouble finding a place to pause.  reeve throws in enough twists and turns to keep readers guessing right until the end, and both art and myrtle get the chance to play hero.    art, as the main character, is not yet a teen himself, so teens may find his narration a little immature for their liking.  if they're willing to give him a chance, though, they will discover that larklight is a fast-paced, imaginative journey well worth taking.    reviewed by:  lynn cro. courtesy of teens read too	1
a very good nontechnical book. kennedy does a great job of providing insight into an often obscure subject. excellent companion book to go along with a more technical book like greene or hayashi. excellent book for intuition	1
has some good topics discussed. would not recommend this book as a starter in labor law. not very informative.	2
as a sales pitch for tellington touch, this book is great. as an instruction manual, it is totally worthless. complex gestures such as those mentioned in the book need illustrations that take one step-by-step through the manipulation process. there aren't any, just a few photos that show one stop action part of the whole.     it did get me to take a t-touch workshop, which was beneficial for my old and arthritic dog. the process works. the book doesn't. great ideas but totally inadequate instruction	2
i bought the panther edition of this book, and found it contained a great deal of useful information. however, i felt it did not serve well for a reference material for two reasons...    1. this book is huge. it needs to be perfect bound or made into two separate volumes.    2. though the index is quite extensive, there is no way to adequately search the book for troubleshooting mac osx.    both points would be obviated by the inclusion of a cd containing an ebook, preferably as a pdf. i reported this to the publisher, but apparently they disagree since this version does not include a disc. for this reason, i have decided not to purchase this book until future editions include this. i'm writing this here in hopes that the publisher will read this, and act accordingly. no cd no buy	0
"my biggest complaint is willis's assumptions about the reader. she assumes every reader is deeply and fundamentally flawed, with money only exacerbating existing conditions. people that are relatively level-headed and well-adjusted will find little in this book about the trouble money can bring. they will, however, find out how money affects those that already have psychological issues. the book should not be used as a predictor of the problems that come with money.    moreover, she also assumes that the reader is well-versed in christian values and are open to christian citations, further narrowing readability. in chapters where a case-file would be helpful, willis instead harkens to biblical texts and the parables of jesus to validate her insights.    for interest's sake, willis also highlights mostly stories of the extreme, case-files that seem to relate to only few people. occasionally, an example will be aptly targeted toward most of the audience, but most of the time, the cases apply to people that have inherited many millions or posses standing, major psychological issues. furthermore, the lessons that the author distills from her case files are rather ambiguous and broad. it is a somewhat veiled example of ""fortune cookie"" therapy. in the key moments where willis could show the reader how to learn from the extreme cases, the author resorts to a very unspecific retelling of the case-file, with little insight about how to improve.    the book might have been substantially stronger given more real-life examples with deft analyses. in addition, the book has an overall patronizing nature that needs to be addressed. the author, someone that has seen so many problems afflicting inheritors, has the chance to truly help without adding too many personal feelings but instead insists on injecting an air of moral superiority.    i picked up the book as a complete novice in the world of inheritance and its ramifications. unfortunately, i remain as such, due to the handbook's narrow aim and arrogant nature. didactic and morally condescending"	0
a wonderful, lucid, entertaining and informative guide. craig takes the reader step-by-step through some of the principal works of ancient and modern philosophy, and provides us with an essential guide to the somewhat daunting task of deciphering and understanding a range of compelling thinkers and their works. with an engaging, friendly writing style (and an excellent bibliography to encourage us to continue our journey), this is an indispensable little volume. useful in the extreme.	1
"this is a great telling of the story of ruby bridges, the first african american child to attend an all-white new orleans school.  the book does a very good job of explaining on a child's level, what ruby went through and why.  the book was written by a child psychiatrist who witnessed her going into school and being shouted at by the angry mob and met with to allow her an outlet for her fears and feelings.    don't give too much credence to the reviewer who slammed the book because of the ""pointless"" religious scene. the mentions of religion are not pointless because faith is what helped ruby and her family through this difficult time...faith in god was part of who they were.  furthermore, although the book doesn't directly go into gory details about the things that were said to and about ruby, it clearly explains that the whites didn't want their children in school with ruby and why.  no book is going to answer all a child's questions on any subject, but this one is a great way to open up the lines of communication and a great way to introduce the subject.    an interesting side note: according to ruby bridges web site, mrs. henry, her beloved teacher, was not rehired by william franz elementary school the following year.  one must assume that her loving care of ruby and her refusal to subscribe to the racist views made her unwelcome. wonderful book"	1

i have read several of barbara michaels' books and have to say that this may actually be the best one i have read!  i borrowed it from the library and was so entranced by the story that i read it in one day.  now i plan to purchase a copy from amazon for a place on my bookshelf - which isn't that  easy to qualify for! only the very best books gain a place there.  and this  book is a great one. one of her best!   couldn't put it down!	1

this text provides an interesting overall account of oddities that happened during one of the greatest conflicts of all time.  there are some factual data within the book that well-versed readers have identified that could possibly be considered in a later edition.  for these individuals, there are countless multi-volume and 500+ page accounts of the history of world war ii.  however, to a novice, this work provides short, readable sections about interesting and less known aspects of the second world war.  this book makes one reflect on the strange little things that can alter the course of human history.  if nothing else, it raises your curiosity to read more works on the topic or the issue or story that you are most interested in.  after all, isn't that what reading and exploring information is all about. good for a fun read	2

this is the most disappointing piece of childish trash i have encountered in many a day.  i have absolutely wasted my money and feel cheated.  this piece of junk is without literary value of any kind.  if you enjoy reading about a cop who is going to a shrink to get free, of among many things, a drinking problem, but who continually walks around evenings with a stiff drink in his hand moaning about how much he loves his ex wife who is having affairs with others, then this is your piece of writing.  notice i didn't say literature.  an extremely poorly written piece of garbage!!. from kansas	0

"""the killing sky"" is the fifth book in robert gandt's great series of novels about brick maxwell, and it's one of the two best. (my other favorite is ""acts of vengeance"", the second book in the series.)    brick maxwell is a u.s. navy pilot and squadron leader, flying an f/a-18 super hornet off the aircraft carrier uss ronald reagan, stationed in the eastern end of the mediterranean sea. the story starts with a joint exercise with the israeli air force ending with an american f/a-18 getting shot down for real!    what went wrong? did the israeli pilot really push the missile launch button instead of just announcing a simulated kill? and why does the female israeli mossad agent make a play for brick maxwell? is she trying to get information out of him or does she have other motives?    this book contains the same three general plot elements as most of robert gandt's novels:    - exciting ""you're sitting in the cockpit"" descriptions of modern navy flight operations, with dogfights, carrier-based landings and takeoffs, and push-button warfare with modern smart bombs and missiles.    - geopolitical machinations, this time involving high-level americans and israelis and palestinians. and to keep the excitement up there are internal conflicts within each national group, including a really nasty american political envoy with presidential ambitions.    - romantic involvement for brick, this time involving not just one but two women.    i liked this book a lot, despite the rather slow start. the suspense gets cranked up by the under-handed dealings going on between the politicians and the resulting armed conflicts between the palestinians, the israelis and the american forces. is the united states really going to invade palestine and engineer a democratic process, just like in iraq? and who is really behind the decisions that are causing the continued escalation of hostilities?    one of my criticisms of robert gandt's novels is that the characters don't really come across as real people. this is still true in ""the killing sky"", but less so than in the first books in the series, another plus for this book.    recommended for all fans of military action novels, as is the whole brick maxwell series.    rennie peterse. modern navy pilots have become push-button warriors"	2
this is a good book for those who know how to use a pda and are experts at reading and writing code.  it is not for beginners or those who have never seen win ce.  but if you love computers and techie gadgets, are good with code and like to play with electronic toys, are looking for another techie's love of toys, then you might get something out of it.  but if you are inclined in that way you already know this stuff.  don't waste your money.  there are other books that do a better job in both area. don't waste your money	0

i thought the narrator was terrible. she is under the impression that people in upstate new york have southern accents.  or maybe she never figured out where the story takes place. it must be the mint juleps that confused her. you'd think there would be an editor or coach that would notice this discrepancy, but i guess if nobody could be bothered to edit the author's work, they certainly couldn't worry about the narrator's accents. southern accents?	2
"i can see very little reason for the dalai lama to write a book on science.  he is out of his league in writing this book.  he does not at all understand his subject matter.  his points on the convergence of modern physics and buddhist philosophy are irrelevant.  first, any similarities between modern cosmology or quantum mechanics and buddhist philosophy are purely coincidental, and are not reflective of any deep truth.  we arrive at scientific knowledge through a process of hypothesization and experimentation, the hypotheses being rigidly defined and definitely falsifiable.  buddhist philosophy does not contain this same element of falsifiability, its grounding in the empirical world being loose and open to interpretation.  one cannot describe an objective procedure to rigorously falsify a buddhist claim.  further, these claims are not rigidly defined, and widely open to interpretation, unlike the claims of modern physics, which result in a single answer to a calculation (although in practice one will end up making subjective approximations, but there is a procedure for estimating the error incurred in these approximations).  second, it is not at all surprising that one can draw some superficial parallels between physics and buddhism, because the body of buddhist thought is large enough and equivocal enough that one could point to similarities no matter what physics' worldview is.    i do not understand the dalai lama's request that research in the subject of consciousness include internal examination.  the definition of the nature of this internal examination is unclear, and procedure for carrying it out are not described.  his suggestions are useless to scientists without being made more clear.  his claims on what science is and is not capable of achieving or understanding are based on insufficient knowledge.  even respected, established scientists who make claims on what science cannot achieve have historically been proven incorrect many times over.    i commend the dalai lama's interest in science.  further, i am amazed at his open-mindedness in writing, ""if scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims.""  he proved true to his word in renouncing certain buddhist beliefs about the physical workings of the universe.    however, his understanding of the method and teachings of science proved superficial when he argued that because science has not conclusively proven it completely understands the beginning of the universe or the origin of life, this leaves room for supernatural influence to have caused the universe to exist, or for new souls to inherit old ones through reincarnation.  science treats questions of the supernatural (defined as those things beyond nature, in other words those things that can not be observed) as fundamentally unanswerable and uninteresting, but the dalai lama does not seem to understand this attitude.    the dalai lama has discussed science with many leading researchers and philosophers of science, such as david bohm and arthur zajonc.  i have no doubt that these he is well-informed, and that these men have done their best to impart their knowledge.  but the gap between western and eastern thought in this case may be too wide to be easily bridged, and the responsibility lies in another man to do it.  it may be that no one alive has a truly deep understanding of both buddhist philosophy and the philosophy of science.    finally, i also applaud the dalai lama's calls for collaboration, and his attempts to spread some introductory knowledge of buddhist thought.  but the task of creating productive dialogues between scientists and buddhists is an overwhelming one, involving not only language barriers, but barriers involving fundamental modes of thought.  this book is not equal to the challenge, but i think the dalai lama's initial efforts are at least a step in the right direction. full of inappropriate conclusions, but well-intentioned"	2
"this (2004 edition) is an updated re-publication of davies' 1988 book. in the new preface, davies (mathematical physicist, prolific writer, recipient of the faraday prize, the kelvin medal, and the templeton prize) suggests the possibility of something quite outlandish--that if humanity can somehow survive the full future of the universe, that upon the universe's thermodynamic and quantum demise, our descendants might scramble into a new universe of their own manufacture. the assertion brings several thoughts to mind, we might begin with, well, let's say, idea-heisting [i'll not say plagiar_sm, that would be a bit harsh]. (frank tipler famously envisioned this kind of scenario in a universe headed for a ""big crunch."" the big crunch has currently fallen out of favor with astronomers and theorists, and davies' invented universe envisions the currently favored thermodynamic ""big fade away"" scenario.) it also might strike us as unrealistic or even arrogant; but, foolish or not, davies' reason for such 'optimism' is unveiled in the following 200 pages.    what follows is a fast-paced and critical tour-de-force of the state of current and emerging scientific theories and prospects (promising and otherwise) for the future. there are many outstanding discussions, one centered on the mathematics of self-similar scaling -- the ""mandelbrot set"" being a famous example. davies believes that, in principle, science will one day explain, comprehensively, how the world works. don't hold your breath, we're not exactly close to that day just yet. in some significant areas, notably the deepest theoretical understandings of biological and mind sciences, there seems to have been rather little progress at all. from popular treatments [like glossy spreads in national geographic magazine, or discovery channel shows], one might be led to believe that great insights have been gained into how biological evolution proceeds and how life arises spontaneously from non-life. davies surveys the competing claims and theories in these disciplines and exposes them as being starkly impotent to date. (there is a popular myth that only religious fundamentalists are skeptical of the neo-darwinian story line -- but many of the most penetrating minds of modern theoretical science and mathematics, including werner heisenberg, niels bohr, john von neumann, and kurt godel, among others, have found the darwinian story to be non-compelling at best, and on some points glaringly wrong. as davies points out, a world in which 'natural selection' was the great generative engine, supporting only reproductive advantages, many life forms that we observe, like elephants [low birth rate, long gestation period, etc], could not have been 'selected' into existence. it does no good to protest that elephants should not and could not reproduce like bunnies -- in a truly darwinian world there simply should not be elephants [or humans: striving to discern whether the universe might be headed toward a 'big crunch' or a 'heat death' can offer no reproductive advantage for beings given to contemplating such things!]. one thinks of many darwin-confuters in the plant kingdom. a world built by darwinian mechanisms would be populated only by masters of mitosis, and perhaps sex-maniacs that mated like bunnies, although sex itself, a comparatively inefficient means of reproduction [obviously when compared to mitotic reproduction], is another intractable problem for the darwinian story.) davies, like many noted physicists, is well studied and articulate in theoretical biology, and finds the state of neo-darwinian evolutionary theory to be mostly a patched-up, just-so story that is easy fodder for skepticism. he does, however, believe that stuart kaufmann's ideas concerning holistic approaches to understanding complexity may be more fruitful. however i give a wrong impression if i seem to suggest that the book is largely about biological evolution, it is not. this is but one of several illuminating discussions, most of which understandably center on mathematical physics.    davies, an epistemological optimist at any rate, expects that theoretical biology and mind science will one day succumb to our advancing knowledge, and that we will know, exhaustively, how the world works. but to know how the world works is not to know why the world works. even if science should attain a reductionistic ""theory of everything"" and a stunning cadre of holistic theories explaining all features of 'emergence' and 'complexity', the big why question(s) will remain, and any answers will remain as matters of faith, not strict science. science speaks to ""how,"" but why should this be so? why should there be an explainable world and why should it contain world-explainers? one can deny teleological inference and many materialists insist [religiously] on doing so, but the denial is one of personal choice, not actual science. the world is 'up to something,' and this fact is fundamentally written into the new physics. the mysterious profundity of ""why"" always remains. in the day that davies foresees, when physical science has achieved its final triumph, it will not have dispensed with god and it will not have written purpose out of the world.    well, that's the book in a nutshell, but there's much more to it. i've read something like ten of davies' books; most of them being either 'good' or 'very good' (with one notable exception) and this volume fits either category, except, perhaps, for that wild assertion in the new preface. is there a cosmic blueprint?"	1
"for $10 i guess its fine, but i didn't learn anything from this book at all.  if anything, i actually feel more alienated.  i do not live in the gay neighborhood of my city nor do i hang out exclusively with gay people.  however, coexisting with straight people isn't even a passing thought in this book.  basically, if you don't live as a cher-worshipping rainbow flag waving poster child of gaydom, the book paints you as a maladjusted closet case who should be avoided at all costs.  i agree with the review that said this is a good guide to turning into a ""flaky queen"".  also, i cannot even count the number of times alcohol is referred to in this book (and i rarely drink) but any drug use is met with a ""kick him to the curb, girlfriend"" attitude (i don't do drugs either, but i'm just pointing it out).  the book does not answer any central questions about what men want.  there is research out there about how important a good body *really* is and how important masculine traits really are for a relationship vs. hookup.  this author did not pull any of that in.  however, there is an underlying assumption that all gay men go to the gym, and usually that is an all-gay gym (so i guess a good body is really important to him...).  as far as the authors take on the value that gay men place on education or personal growth - oh wait - neither topic is ever mentioned.  the whole book can be summed up with the fact that the author actually gives advice on ""what to say if he catches you looking at his streisand cds when he comes out of the bathroom"".  so, essentially, the book is a disappointing series of common-sense superficial tips that anyone who went to high school already knows:  ""don't seem needy or desperate, be confident, don't go into your whole life story on the first date.""  i mean, if you're that clueless about dating... then go for it.   maybe i would've found this useful at 16 or 17, however.  (oh, by the way i just learned that being 30 is old.  it's mentioned about 4 times.)  i also like how there is a whole chapter devoted to what you should hide & display in your bathroom (aveda = bad... generic shaving cream = good). um, by the time a guy is in my bathroom, he is probably on his way to having sex with me so i think it'll just have to be ok if he sees moisturizer with retinol.  if he wants to end the relationship over my brand of shaving cream (yes, that is mentioned as well) then i'm done too.  what is amazing is that in previous chapters, ""being your fabulous gay self"" is encouraged, but now we're playing ""hide the gay cosmetics?""   the book is replete with hypocritical counsel, vague generalizations, and inconsistencies.  i suppose, then, it is more of a metaphor of gay dating than a guide to it. nothing new.  not that funny"	0
it is the screenplay of the movie, the same one that should have won the oscar this year.  for people who haven't seen the movie, reading the screenplay first may not be such a great idea.  i know this movie went over a lot of people's heads, and i'm not positive one can fully appreciate the story from just reading it.  however, i definately recommend reading it after seeing the movie, there is so much great dialogue that is easily missed and a lot of subtle humor that is more obvious written on the page.  this was one of the best movies of 2001 and the screenplay is a great way to appreciate it again while waiting for the dvd. this is not a novel...	1

first things firts.....i am clueless as to why the reviews online for this book have stars enough to fill the sky. unless written by friends (that too, the really good and loyal ones) the book would not deserve even a 2 star. infact i looked for 1/2 a star and couldnt find one.    the narration is plainly put, silly and yada yada. rambling without a direction and generous usage of indian words like chambu is totally uncalled for considering the that the target is a world audience. amulya should read  and re re re read arundati roy's god of small things to see how the soft balance between something indian yet talking crystal clear to the western soul is acheived. i read blurbs of the other books written by amulya and the narrative is as blah as it is in this one. i am not trying to be vicious here, but plain frank since the other reviews are so unreasonably off the target.    a very boringly, tedious, soporiphic rambling of a book. i would not recommend this to any one. very badly written book	0
"ehhh... i'm just not real impressed with this one.  first of all - splitting the larger sun sign categories into subgroups is kinda nice, but also kinda vague.  it's essentially a re-working of the standard sun sign stereotypes, and if you're interested in astrology at all, you know them already.  don't get me wrong - it's not *bad.*  there's no wrong information, it's passably accurate (for astrology.)  i can see how it would be very helpful for those on cusps, and even for the rest of us, it's occasionally got some new info (this book, for instance, is the first one to accurately point out some quieter aspects of my personality that go against the aries norm.)  it's just not enough to get excited over, and most people will get the same level of accuracy or better by just going whole hog and getting a star chart done.    secondly, and more irritatingly, the actual relationship pairings were astonishingly scattershot.  i think it would have been easier to deal with if they'd all just been laughably wrong, but no - after slogging through, say, 4 or 5 descriptions that could have been describing total strangers (because they certainly weren't describing me and my people), i'd hit upon something like ""confidential projects,"" which was just a spot-on explanation of the vibe between me & my brother.  what do you do with a book like that?  (also?  as has been noted by other reviewers, the book really is amazingly negative about almost every relationship pairing.  if i were to take it seriously, i'd be huddled in the corner now, wide-eyed, whimpering ""nobody loves me and i have no real friends!""  sheesh.)    it leads me to one of two conclusions: 1) it really is scattershot - they're just throwing it at a wall and seeing what sticks; or, 2) they're actually on to something, but haven't worked out all the kinks yet.  which wouldn't be too bad, except that it's being published as a finished product, you know?    final recommendation: pass.  if you're reading for entertainment, there are more entertaining astrology books out there; if you're a serious student, there are more thorough and accurate books.  if you've got money to burn and don't mind weeding through the stuff that's superfluous and the stuff that's just inaccurate to find the few true additions to this field that this book makes, it might make a decent addition to round out a library.  just please don't be fooled into thinking this is the be-all and end-all of relationship astrology. hit or miss..."	2
"boy, i hate to point out a negative here, but to say that fundamentalism is a way of holding a belief and not about content is historically ill informed. fundamentalism began as a reaction against denominational seminaries adopting theological views that were viewed as against scripture in their content. here are a few of those issues. you tell me if you think they are content or ways of holding it:  jesus was not born of a virgin.  many of the miracles of jesus were fictional.  jesus did not necesarily raise from the dead.  most of the more outrageous old testament stories were not to be taken as historically accurate.  i could go on. has he not read what really happened historically to create that movement??? big mistake, or real dishonest! even now rollins goes about building what they reacted against. rollins says he will not be undermining chrisitan content, but he is opening the door for those who will. in fact, for him to make the following statement about life after death makes me wonder if he really cares about truth or his post modern posture. ""death is a term that refers to the end of all experience. regardless of what, if anything, happens after this event,...""page 47   he strives to make his own point at the expense of christian truth.   fundamentalism, even today, in it's popularly decried ""no fun, too much dam, and not enough mental"" caricature is really primarily about content and only secondarily about how they hold their views.  it was born in a fight and rollins wants to take us back into the fight. evangelicalism is the answer as to content and holding it rightly, but rollins really does not believe in answers. learn the lessons of history or repeat it"	0

another masterpiece from donaldson.  pick it up and read it.... if you like it try out his other books.      the story of angus and morn  continues, even more gripping and well developed than in the first book.   like the real story, there is bleakness and desolation, but they only serve  to highlight the characters.  the extremes that they are forced to  experience shape them and make them believable as individuals, and make  this book very dramatic and powerful.  you are brought to understand and  care about the characters, and by the end you will find yourself looking on  to the next book.   after reading this book i went out and bought the rest  of the series.... i had no fears about being disappointed by any of the  books, and i wasn't.  two other people in my family were hooked on this  series as well, once i showed it to them(they almost strangled me for  losing the third book :). another masterpiece	1
ok so when i first started reading the book i thought all right this is ok.  and the book went along and i still thought it was ok good at times but just a decent book.  then i finished the book and i realized something.  nothing had happened really.  there was nothing to tell you what the overall plot would be for the triolgy it was just them going from once place to the other.  its like oh there is a ghost we should follow it, yeah because that is such a smart thing to do.  this book just annoyed me so much because nothing happend in it.  i don't really understand why so many people love this book.  this book is average at best and not much else. this book annoyed me.	0
first, i'd like to stress that this book, just like its title indicates, is not supposed to appeal to the nostalgia-ridden fans and conspiracy theorists that once found common ground on movies like 'jfk.' seymour hersh's 'dark side of camelot' is indicting as it is jaw-dropping.  in one of the more revealing accounts, hersh takes on the task of dispelling the peace-loving, freedom-advocate myth surrounding the j.f. kennedy cult by confirming a long-held, yet underrated perpective that historical events such as the cuban missile crisis were in great part exacerbated by the late president and his brother robert's domestic political ambitions, even when doing so required using the mafia as a reliable ally for the defense of the 'free world' as depicted by the kennedys. it was  the kennedys' obsesion to bring castro down and the urge to appear 'strong of communism' that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war with the prospect of a catastrophic invasion that was planned after the bay of pigs fiasco. hersh accounts of us and soviet generals, cia officers, and other sources of authority complement this view with chilling details.    the vietnam war also had kennedy's fingerprints all over it, according to hersh's findings. kennedy's was as eager as richard nixon to continue running the war at the expense of hundreds of thousands of lives when the former approved of vietnamese strongman diem's murder, although kennedy was well aware that diem and his brother had started backchannel negotiations with the communist and buddhist opposition in south vietnam to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. at the end, diem's pro-us rivals in the military took over and resumed the reign of terror and reppression that had been encouraged by kennedy's most hawkish advisers in the pentagon.     the 'dark side of camelot' is not only a political indictment of john f. kennedy, but also an impeachment on utter immorality by a u.s. head of state. in one of at least four main accounts from ex-secret service officers, president kennedy was courted by members of his cabinet with young club girls who were often threatened with lock-ups in asylums if they dared to speak about their sexual anecdotes with president kennedy and his entourage. kennedy's promiscuous behavior opened the door for venereal diseases, such as chlamydia, to haunt him until the day of his death, according to medical records cited by hersh.   for revelations like these ones, it is likely that the 'dark side of camelot' be dismissed as a gossip-teller on the sexual life of john f. kennedy, however, it will prove immensely valuable for those who wish to pursue the trail of elussive puzzle parts that shaped u.s. government policy during some of the most impacting world events of the 20th century. the side few knew	1

"j.c. hallman's the chess artist is structured around a trip that the author took with his friend glenn, the chess player of the book's title, to kalmykia, a crumbling russian republic on the northwest shore of the caspian sea. hallman was interested in interviewing kalmykia's despotic president, kirsan ilyumzhinov, a former chess prodigy and the president of the world chess federation (fide), who was using chess ""as a tool to unify and mollify his people."" (he had made chess instruction compulsory in schools, for example.) woven around the story of their journey are chapters on chess history--its development and geographical migration across a thousand years, the history of its individual pieces--and hallman's further adventures with glenn: marathon chess sessions over the internet, formal chess competitions, blindfolded chess and speed chess, chess played in prison and in princeton, and the various characters they ran across on their adventures--child prodigies and the denizens of dickensian chess shops and the down-and-out chess hustlers of new york's washington square park.    part travelogue, then, and part history, hallman's book is also an exploration of both the international subculture of competitive chess and of his traveling companion. for most of the period covered by the book, glenn was ranked as a chess master--exceptionally good but well below the grandmasters who form the true elite of the chess world. glenn is an enigmatic character. a germophobic 39-year-old with a genius for the game and poor grammar, he is apparently incapable of consistently making smart decisions in the real world. divorced and perpetually broke, almost childish at times, his friendship seems to be to a great extent a burden. hallman has a tendency, actually, to write about glenn as if he were a sort of lab animal, whose mannerisms and mode of play are alike under scrutiny.    ""he shrugged and performed a gesture that was new to me, opening his palms suddenly and at the same time contorting his face to an expression of exaggerated surprise.""    annoying and strange, given to marking promising relationships with ceremonial whistling, glenn is also a sad figure, a broken man ""spiraling toward nothingness, a waste of twenty years of effort and energy."" one wonders what glenn thought of his presentation in the book.    the chess artist is very well researched and thick with information. and it is punctuated by some truly wonderful, sometimes poetic writing:    ""the train was all lullaby, the gyroscopic jostle of the tracks, the steady click of the wheels like the eighth notes of some slower melody, the stars stationary out the small window, all of it a lull of travel nostalgia, a cradle or warm womb, glenn and i like twins incubating in that cramped space.""     in kalmykia hallman is served ""a genocide of crayfish""; in a prison cafeteria the fare is instead ""hockey pucks of meat like the leftover scrapings of a botched autopsy."" one chess player they observe has the ""eyebrows of a demon,"" while another is ""a nondescript man who fit the profile of a serial killer--short, well-groomed, quiet, and very dangerous.""    hallman's writing is riddled with such evocative descriptions. this is both wonderful and, surprisingly perhaps, problematic: the problem is that hallman tends to lavish his well-written descriptions on nearly every minor character who crosses his path, so that the reader is met with too much information. hallman's flair is obvious. but after a time, the personalities in the book tend to blend together.    it is tempting to say that hallman does for chess what stefan fatsis does for scrabble in his book word freak, exposing the weird underbelly of an intellectual pastime, the obsessives who sacrifice sleep and hygiene over their chosen game. hallman's book, though, is a more serious and more difficult read. presumably, the more familiar a reader is with chess, the more he will get out of the book. i myself do not play, but i was able to understand and appreciate, at least on some level, most of what the author had to say. non-chess players should not be afraid of diving in.    debra hamel -- author of trying neaira: the true story of a courtesan's scandalous life in ancient greece (yale university press, 2003. the weird underbelly of an intellectual pastime"	2
this was a good book because it show some values that you can find on the family, and how emily try to understand why her mama didn't like the desert. after she start to find answers at her questions she also get to know better her grandmama ola by making a videotape where she get to know better ola's friends and learn to get along with people. this book show the way that this people were traveling scaping from something that is call saness going through different places, the real reason that ola was runing away from alabama was to save diane from the ugliness deth like it say on the book but this wasn't the good way because you have to get infrom of your problems to solves them. that is why i agree with diane that ola wasn't suppose to run away fron something she shouldn't. by the time emily find the reason diane didn't like the desert was because she didn't want to get away from the pain of her father that she found dead near a field of kudzu. that was the day that emily really felt for her mama and understand her loss. it say that diane won't ever forgive her mother from ripping it away. because i think that the only things that where attach to diane and that she remember about her father were gone and the only memory she has about her father were in her heart and that is okay because she will never forget her father even that she don't have any oject that may remember her him. i think that emily realize that it really don't take that long to get to know someboy if you really want to know them. i think emily haves a positive change because she learn to appreciate more her family and to understand the situation they hava passe. i think ola and emily really like the desert because there they really felt free like a bird and freedon if one of the most important value in the world. if you don't think like that i do. i really like this book even that it show all the pain this people have and or their loss. but at the end it really teach you that family is very important if you haven't read this book do it because it can help you to apreciate it more. that all i have to say i hope you like what i have done. toning the sweep	2

"if you want your dogma reinforced then this is a great book. it blazes through philosophical arguments with proposterous nerve.    example 1. the problem of evil is solved thus:  ""and god has done something about the problem of evil. he has done the most dramatic, costly, and effective thing possible by giving his son to die for evil men.""    example 2. to john wisdoms damning parable, the book argues: ""for in christianity we do not have merely an allegation that the garden of this world is tended by a loving gardener; we have the actual, empirical entrance of the gardener into the human scene in the person of christ (cf. john 20: 14,15), and this entrance is verifiable by way of his resurrection.""     all of the arguments assume the ignorant position. the argument from design is entertained in the most ridiculous manner -arguing from the specific to the general. reality is simple -we are here because things are the way they are -if they weren't, we wouldn't be here. too many leaves in the teacup being read by those who want to see things that are not there. i'm afraid for humanity if they think this is knowledge. reinforced dogma"	0

i have read all of barbara delinsky's books.  of those books, there have been a number of rereleases.  what is annoying is that alot of romance writers are doing this, and their material is not always as good as the current price of a paperback.  if a book was released in 1983 the price of  the paperback should be lower, and the cover of the paperback should also  have an indication that this book has just been rereleased with the current  content untouched.  i'm from ottawa, canada and this paperback was very expensive. alot of money for an outdated storyline and not much of a story to tell. old delinsky material is misleading and not very good!	0
while the characters of this story are engaging, there's no follow through.  you don't really get an idea of what happens to people at the end.  you are left to your own imagination for a lot of instances.  i understand that it is christian fiction since it refers to numerous biblical quotes, but we really don't get an idea of people's faith.  the people don't really seem to have a relationship with god.  i was truly disappointed. disappointing	2
i teach short-story writing, and i've had my students read this book because it shows that there is still a way to &quot;make it new&quot; in the story form.  arvin's stories, all of them, have nice surprises in form or content. he is not satisfied with cliches or overused word or character packages. his historical pieces don't smack of research, but present a complex world with compelling characters. the stories are not of interest to solely writers; they're compelling to anyone who cares about the human heart. i look forward to reading his novel, articles of war, which i've heard is coming out from doubleday in january 2005. truly interesting and unconventional stories	1
"what a difference three years can make. between 1930 (when hammett finished ""the glass key,"" perhaps his bleakest work) and 1933 (when he published ""the thin man,"" his last novel), hammett had discovered two things that transformed his outlook on life: a steady income from book sales and from hollywood filmwriting and, perhaps more important, lillian hellman.     there's surely nothing like being unexpectedly wealthy and suddenly in love: hammett's changed outlook on life is even more apparent when one compares the 65-page outline of ""the thin man"" he set aside in 1931 with the final version of his book, which seems to be more of a light-hearted and satirical tribute to the traditional whodunit than a continuation of the gloomy noir of his earlier novels.    while his first four novels, as well as the early draft, featured an anti-establishment loner (the continental op, sam spade, ned beaumont), ""the thin man"" introduces nick and nora charles as a pair of unlikely crime-busters breaking off their vacation in new york (which consists mostly of drinking at any available venue) to solve a murder. readers with only a passing knowledge of hammett's biography will recognize both hammett and hellman as the inspirations for the alcoholic ex-sleuth and his socially savvy wife.    what also separates ""the thin man"" from hammett's other full-length works is its giddy humor, which revolves around seedy nightlife, early-morning alcohol consumption, and nick and nora's freethinking rapport, while the dialogue pokes fun at the tough-guy image and the mystery form itself. the morning after being grazed by a bullet, nora asks nick: ""how do you feel?"" ""terrible, i must've gone to bed sober."" this playful banter takes up much of the book and supplies one of its greatest pleasures.    many hammett fans have long regarded ""the thin man"" as his weakest novel, and i tend to agree--up to a point. this book lacks the quality for which the others are famous: uniqueness (for lack of a better word). although it's a sophisticated manhattan comedy, hammett's last detective novel is a lot like many other whodunits, and his unexpectedly relaxed and newly satisfied voice often doesn't ring true. even so, it's a shining example of the traditional mystery and a lot of fun to read. ""this excitement has put us behind in our drinking."""	2
"i have never enjoyed reading the novels of one historical romance author so much. but this was a dissapointment ms. small! altough she always has bored me a trifle with her details, the plots are usually well thought out and intriguing. but in this novel, after finding the love of her life, patrick has dementia and they cancel their wedding plans. after two years she lets logan who pursues her constantly throughout the novel take her body and her hand in matrimony after she refuses him so long! when it says: ""rosamund sat up. what was she doing? she jumped from her bed, lokking to gather up her other garments. ""you shall not have me you monster!"" i thought she was coming to her senses and would finally wait on her true love to regain his memory , but alas twas not to be. she should not have married again. it was tantamount to a betrayal! i am so mad atms. small for ending this book this way! i give the book two stars for the romance of a lifetime she allowed us to see between rosamund and patrick. until you"	2
this book is incredibly boring and tedious to read.  it has no plot; i fell asleep every time i tried to read it.  it isn't realistic, as some attest, becuase the indians have the ability to talk to animals.  remarkably, their dreams are always perfectly accurate prophecies; james welch takes foreshadowing a little too far.  a final warning: this book is not appropriate for younger readers due to excessive descriptions of sexual desires and acts, including adultery and incest. bad	0
this is a very readable text that distills the essential clinical  information that you will need on your em rotation.  it is well cross  referenced and gives an excellent intro to the material.  i would not use  it as your only text as it does not have enough depth on its own.  this  text will suffice however if you have some background knowledge upon which  to build on.  overall a great tex. an excellent intro text for students interested in em	1
the author made a huge mistake with this one.  it is so basic, meaning a lack of pictures and good graphics to lower its cost, that it ends up driving no point home at all.  this book is a complete waste of time.  the  only plus is that it is one of the only true general virology textbooks out  there. ineffective text book	2
"we read this book as a part of our homeschool history curriculum this year.  it was very informative and entertaining. my children (ages 6 and 8) absolutely loved it.   we have the older version, and my kids didn't even mind the lack of color and the sparse illustrations.  they begged me ,""one more chapter...please, mom?!""    i would say the only thing i did not care for in this book was the way they portray the indians.  other than squanto, samoset and massasoit, all of the other indians are viewed as 'savages' (and not very intelligent ones, at that.)   in the last few chapters, they are even used as 'comic relief.'   she also has them speaking the word 'ugh' a lot...such as ""ugh! white squaw bring me cider!""  i thought that was a little unrealistic, and insulting as well.    the information on the pilgrims is wonderful, and she really brought their journey alive.    if you can overlook the indian parts, i would highly recommend this book. an excellent read - my kids begged to do history!"	1
great book, couldn't put it down until i finished it! if you like the history of how a great race car was born and how three special guy's, wilbur shaw, ted horn and cotton henning made the masarati 8ctf a legend, get this book! this car was a winner in 1939-40, should have won in 1941, and finished no worse than 4th from 1946 to 1948. it was still competing in the 500 until 1951. umbrella mike: true story of a chicago gangster behind the indy 500	1

i have cherokee lineage and decided to learn our history, which was not passed down in our family, so i got this book to read in good faith.  the author makes us sound like a bunch of backward, bloodthirsty, superstitious people, and our women to be a bunch of promiscuous (...).  there is little in the book of the trail of tears, and much of what is written prior to it gets off into flights of fancy and imagination of the author, who believes he can mind read for people dead over 150 years.  when he does get around to the actual trail of tears (the last sixth of the book) he briefly accounts what facts or accounts there were, and gets into how not that many people really died, and the federal government is being portrayed in a bad light historically.  he also portrays the cherokee nation's history as rising and falling with the beginning and ending of his book, treating the cherokee as a quaint, dead culture and people.  it saddens me that college students are being given this to read.  i learned nothing about my culture and our history from this book. this is the worst and most offensive book i have read	0
"a short way into chapter i, we have ""...the world had such a large supply of girls, and an even larger supply of perverts.""  really? more perverts than girls?  a few pages later, tess, our heroine,  drugs one of these perverts with his own rohypnol, strips him of his clothes, except for his ""briefs and socks"", and throws his clothes in a dumpster. but in the next sentence ""she arranged his wallet, keys, and pager in a pile next to his head and draped his jacket over him.""  without bothering to retrieve the jacket from the dumpster.  there are more examples like these.    when a writer has so little control over the world she creates that absurdities and oxymorons populate it more densely than her characters, i stop reading pretty quickly.  so in fairness i have to say that i only read the first ten percent of this book. maybe it improves later. very sloppy writing"	2
"i had not read much from this author except her 4 book series with beverly lahaye, but when our library had this one in large print, i just picked it up ""accidentally"" and decided to read it. i had not gotten into many pages when i was grabbed by the plot.    i did not even know there was a second chance series and i rather wondered how a secular book could be re-written sucessfully as a christian fiction book, but this one was wonderful.    when wes first met laney, he suspected her of being a stalker and/or kidnapper of children, and he had her arrested. his fears seemed rational until he heard her story. the child of wes and his deceased wife patrice, was adopted right after birth, and laney, the birth mother had finally found them through illegal means. the story then unfolds of two people who have absolutely nothing in common except their love for one little girl, amy. through it all the ghost of wes' dead wife patrice hangs heavily over both their heads as well as amy's.     i felt terri blackstock drew upon some incredible experience as an author to format and carry through with this suspenseful, love-hate story and the twists and turns which led to a very, very strange and almost unbelievable bond between wes and laney.    i wish to thank the author for re-writing this book and for using her talent for her new ""boss"", god. i am now searching for other second chances books by this author. not an accidental read at all!"	1
seth rogovoy has written a rich history of klezmer music that should prove to be an important contribution to the field of jewish music. he has captured the spirit and meaning of this most wonderful and expressive  musical traditon that is currently in the midst of a significant rebirth.  this is an intelligent and loving tribute both to the musical tradition,  and to the men and women who have performed klezmer from generation to  generation. rogovoy gets it right	1
"primality know for his somber novels of great moral dilemmas usually in developing world setting, ""travels with my aunt"" is something of a departure for the great graham greene.  with its often absurdly situations this is a deeply comic novel rich in humor.    the story centers on henry pulling, a recently retired banker.  he is stuffy, unimaginative, and not one prone to fun.  shortly after he meets his eccentric aunt, who he has not seen since he was a young child, he ends up on whirlwind travels that are best left for the reader to discover for his or herself.  suffice to say, however, the novel is very funny and the new world the travels open up to pulling are only one part of the fun.  certaily not one of greene's deeper works, but definetly one of his more entertaining ones.    enjoy. loads of fun"	1
maybe it is a strange focus for a book of social studies, not just describing how people talk about themselves, but how they talk about each other.  in the end, i think this is the most interesting part of the book, what it tells us about the gossip of shanghai people. as a person who grew up in shanghai and left eight years ago, i am drawn to all stories of shanghai out of nostalgia and curiousity for my old home.   so i bought this book in the university book store. what i found is an unusual type of story, written by a foreign, well american, man about sex in shanghai.  some things he writes are so familiar to me i laughed out loud.  others are not what i remember of shanghai.  i like best the stories these people tell about their friends. i remembered some of the stories in my street, and it made me laugh. a thoughtful story	2
this book is good if you want to be warned over and over to wash your hands! if you are looking for the difference between viruses and bacteria, actual scientific references or interesting facts about how germs and bacteria live, reproduce and colonize us - look elsewhere. this book was too preachy and didn't have enough information for anyone with a genuine interest in biology, human physiology, or health. superficial analysis 	0
ok i love everything else i have ever read by dara joy, so when i picked this one up i thought i would be in for a good read. now normally i'm the type that starts a book once the kids are in bed and before i know it the sun is coming up and i'm wishing 'why can't anything like that ever happen to me'...well it took three days to force myself through this one and once i was done, instead of wishing i was the herione caught up in some adventure, i was pretty happy just to be me. i could not get close to the characters, or into the story surrounding them. and what kills me is that the story line had sooo much potential...haunted manors, kitchen ghosts...i guess i'm even more disappointed because i really do enjoy dara's other works. if you are going to check this one out i would suggest buying it used. boring!!!!!	2
of course it deserves five stars because of the great author, knowledge of chinese culture, good characters and wonderful story. it involves the delicate balance between the old chinese customs of ancient medicine vs science, the choosing of ones own mate vs the old custom of parents making the choice.  in this case, the family is not peasant but prominent, but the culture just as interesting.  there is no action in this book but more of a love story.  no peasants trying to survive in poverty but a cast of the entitled and a struggle of wills. 5 stars but not my favorite	1
even if you're not a physist you will love this book. amazing man; amazing life	1
"look i enjoyed the book a lot, but got nearer and nearer to the end and noticed the plot wasn't wrapping up.  i got that awful sinking feeling that i had been suckered into a book without a good ending, without closure, which i hate.  sure enough!  at the bottom of the last page they *finally* admit ""armageddon's children ends here.  the story will continue with the publication of terry brooks's next novel.""    nowhere on the front cover, back cover or anywhere else but on the last page does it mention this.  i hate being manipulated, and that's why i gave the book one star, and why the publisher del ray/ballantine books will never get another cent from me. no closure - it's 1st in a series"	0

this has to be one of the worst ever organic chemistry books ever devised.  the author will give a detailed explanation with illustrations and at the very end of the discussion , once you have committed the information to memory,  the book will say that it does not happen this way. the author seems to wax poetic,  however,  he gives no simple list of rules for common nomenclature problems,  for example,  i defy you to find a list of how to name alkanes under iupac rules. all you want is a simple list , for example,  1) find the longest chain of carbons, 2) .........  instead of this you will be exposed to extraneous quotes from plays and movies as well as anecdotes from the authors life.   another complaint is that the book gives several good questions in the text and at the end of the chapter,  but no answers in the back.  if you want the answers,  you have to purchase the 40.00 solution manual.   my condolences to you if your o-chem teacher has been hoodwinked into using this book by  the publisher,  the only advice i can give is that you purchase the solutions manual,   because this gives some very detailed explanations.  good luck, because you will need it. don't buy this book!	0
"i remember the first time i realized that james baldwin was a genius. i picked up one of angela davis's autobiographies. i found one of the most beautifully crafted letters ever exchanged from one writer to another.     and with one five page letter, i fell in love.    i am certain that the price of the ticket must be one of the greatest collections of essays ever bound into a single volume. if someone would like to challenge that, please be my guest. and, i believe that james baldwin is probably the second most widley quoted african american writer in epithets, speeches and dedications after martin luther king. i admit, i have no statistical data to support these claims. i have no quantitative proof. just keep your eyes and ears open and you will understand what i mean. whether it was the text many thousands gone i read in an african history course on slavery, or the article entitled the price of the ticket that i discovered in my art history course. baldwin has left an indelible mark on history.     james warned us that, ""it is very nearly impossible, after all, to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind."" (the can't turn back)     he proved to us that, ""freedom is not something that anybody can be given; freedom is something people take and people are as free as they want to be."" (notes for a hypothetical novel)     long before morrison & cose explanation of the envy of the world we knew, ""alas, that to be an american negro male is also to be a kind of walking phallic symbol: which means that one pays, in one's own personality, for the sexual insecurity of others."" (the black boy looks at the white boy)     before mumia reminded us baldwin informed us, ""what passes for identity in america is a serise of myths about one's heroic ancestors. it's astounding to me, for example that so many people really appear to believe that the country was founded by a band of heroes who wanted to be free."" (a talk to teachers)     and years later we still have not grasped the fact that, ""guilt is a luxury we can no longer afford."" (words of a native son)     perhaps genovese was smiling when baldwin wrote, ""we won our christianity, our faith, at the point of a gun, not because of the example afforded by white christains, but in spite of it. it was very difficult to become a christian if you were a black man on a slave ship, and the slave ship was called ""the good ship jesus.""     perhaps the scarriest thing that baldwin has showed us, is how seldom things change.    any writer, i suppose, feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent. talent is not to be ignored. dreams are to be followed, challenges are to be faced and art is to be created. if they take you in the morning"	1
i couldn't put this down, from the first fishing trip that turns into a life-changing trap, to the final decisions two young men--and older men--have to make about their history, their lives and their role in re-living or changing history.  powerful book.  highly recommended. haunting powerful	1
great, great great! that just sums all there is to be said about this book. with a step by step structure and structured reading this book takes you through the steps of recording, getting the album into the stores, booking concerts and managing the finances. good title for managers and musicians alike, but songwriters and producers will love it too because ti opens up lots of closed doors and gives a lot of unseen information. recommended for novices and experienced people alike, do not miss. excellent	1
as an introduction zen, what has been presented in this book is fine though it could have been done with lot less elitist overtone. i agree zen and its true comprehension does not come easy (i am talking of regular mortals such as myself here) and words as mere symbols for concepts are distorting when conveying zen.     i do not propose that i am an expert on zen or even buddhism in general but i have read a few books on buddhism by thich nhat hanh, dalai lama, chogyam trungpa and others. though an agnostic who does not care for much for organized religion, i do believe the most fundamental benefit of any spiritual/ religious framework is to instill a sense of compassion toward other beings. you need some kind of cultural creation (religious or otherwise) to counter act the natural tendency of a human to be self-serving. in this aspect, i have high regards for non-theistic buddhism and the inclusiveness of vedanta (hinduism) that proposes all religions eventually lead to the same attainment. from this viewpoint i was surprised with this author.    this author may have been one of the leading authorities on zen in his time, but unfortunately he comes as an arrogant, elitist, full of prejudices. he does not miss any opportunity to put down other religions or even other sects of buddhism. only zen as practiced by the rinzai sect is pure, strong and generally worthy of pursuit. any form of spiritualism from the west is of course hopeless since the western mind cannot escape the conditioning of logical thinking.  any spiritualism from india is complex, ceremonial and not practical. other sects of buddhism generally do not have true comprehension, lost their way focusing on non-essentials etc. he reserves his most disparaging remarks for indian religions and monks (and does his best to show that though buddhism originated in india, it is really the chinese and japanese due to their practical nature made something of it).    is this just the standard fundamentalism/ misplaced racism?    i will definitely read other books on zen and go beyond this author. much ado about nothing	0
i have always had a fascination about porfirio rubirosa and this book makes me realize that he really was the latin james bond and an inspiration for the subsequent books and movies.  the book contains truely interesting no where else to be found facts and is written in such an easy to read way. i think that anybody that has ever enjoyed a james bond movie or book should read this book. i am sure that one day this book will be turned into a move. chasing rubi: the truth about porfirio rubirosa the last playboy	1
this is a great book.  it not only gives a feel for life after the end of the show ds9, but very creatively incorporates the time frames and characters from the eras of dax's previous hosts.  e.g. bomes makes an appearance.  highly recommended if you loved the dax character, or star trek in general. terrific book!	1
i made the mistake of buying the first edition of this book (published in 2001), but found it to be an excellent guide to the legal issues involved with public domain textual material.  i have already published one book which relied heavily on public domain materials, and am working on a second, and when i bought this book i had several specific questions that i was trying to answer.  this book answered all of them, as well as some that i hadn't thought of!  i'll probably end up buying the second edition, just to see what has changed in the last few years. excellent, practical advice	1
"henry fielding wrote shamela for the best of all reasons: he needed the money. the fact that richardson's earlier pamela had been begging for burlesque in its absurdities and pretensions can be seen only as a contributory reason. in his preface, fielding makes it clear that he has placed richardson's heroine squarely in his sights. he attempts to expose ""the many notorious falsehoods and misrepresentations of a book called pamela, are exposed and refuted; and all of the matchless arts of that young politician, set in a true and just light."" he makes it pretty clear that in the controversy as to whether pamela's motivation for marrying the cad who tried mightily to seduce her are innocent or mercenary fielding sees as the latter.     like pamela, shamela is a novel (much briefer than pamela) written as letters. but in fielding's hands, shamela is seen as the master manipulator. where pamela faints whenever her mr. b. grabs her, shamela swoons too-but in coarse delight. with each passing episode, fielding inverts the moral universe of richardson so that when one considers richardson's subtitle of pamela as ""virtue rewarded,"" one now sees with crystal clarity that virtue does indeed earn a reward, but the virtue of pamela and the virtue of shamela are alike only in their spelling. i am glad that i read pamela first, for if i had come across shamela first, i am pretty sure that i would have hooted and guffawed at a young innocent whose only crime was to follow on stage a deadly mimic. shamela: parodies-unlike their originals-are read only once"	1
i was touched by the sensitivity, wisdom and honesty of the writer. while  written in an easy readable style, it's a book that goes to the core of  human needs and feelings:love,pain, understanding,belonging and other. i  appreciated dr. saferstein's approach to relationships often from the  woman's point of view.at times it seemed that it was a woman's voice  speaking to me. reading about the writer's personal life, i found many  subtle lessons to apply to my own life. i found it uplifting that grief at  the death of his younger sister resulted in a new reawakaning to all the  things that were dear to him. it made me reflect on my relationships and  what was important to me in life. love lor the living  by  dan saferstein phd	1
jonathan kellerman has been one of my favorite authors for years, particularly the alex delaware novels.  this - non-delaware novel - starts slow but delivers in the end.  the only reason i didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the slow beginning.  i even put it down a time or two thinking i'd never get where he was going, but i'm glad i persisted.  it turned out to be very well worth it.  this is an old fashioned cerebral murder mystery with our hero and amateur sleuth the psychologist doctor lover of the first victim.  eh?  got the hairs standing up?  he is befriended (in an odd circumscribed manner) by an older pathologist who invites him to dinner with friends one evening.  as the murders continue our hero begins receiving obscure clues - and he's not sure who to ascribe them to.  this is a well plotted, very satisfying read if you can make it through the - sorry - slow beginning.  kellerman reveals a whole new side to his writing abilities in this deeply thoughtful mystery.  loved it!. starts slow but ends with an unexpected bang	2
"a wonderful portrait of the dashing, romantic columbo. virtually forgotten for the last half-century, columbo was as popular as bing crosby in the early 1930s and considered a heart-throb on a par with actor rudolph valentino. but at age 26, he was shot and killed by his best friend in a freak accident, ending one of the most promising careers in music and film. columbo was the archetypal 1930s ""crooner,"" who gave ""an impression of emotional restraint, of power in reserve."" despite the co-author credit, the book was in fact written by lanza, a master wordsmith (and author of elevator music, the cocktail, and gravity). penna supplied the copious archival photographs, letters and news clippings that beautifully augment the text. lanza, who calls columbo ""an enigma wrapped inside a press release,"" treats his subject with respect, yet with a proper historical detachment that avoids hagiography. columbo was as talented and charismatic as he was troubled, flawed, ambivalent, and stubborn, and lanza makes no excuses for him. at the same time, the chronology is authoritative, and there's abundant humor, even when considering columbo's inner torment (referring to columbo's pet name for his adored carole lombard, lanza refers to the singer's despair at not getting enough ""quality pookie time""). lanza describing columbo emerging from a swimming pool: ""...a sight no less mythical than venus rising from her half-shell. his dark eyes sparkled as the refracted sunlight grafted a halo around his wet hair, the water pouring like pearls of amniotic effluvia from a chlorinated incubator."" such vivid images tantalize on every page, but the book never bogs down in literary preciousness; it represents solid, well-researched journalism. columbo's love letters to lombard are revealing in their pathetic desperation, demonstrating that the adoration of a million wistful female fans cannot allay unrequited passion. an excellent read, and the cast of characters are richly drawn. the dark side of the croon"	1
i really liked this book.  it was funny and well-written and all those things that you like in a book.  however, all of the reviews i read of this book said that mary anne was to blame, but i think dawn was a little, too.  what i mean is, she wasn't very sympathetic to mary anne. poor mary anne was moving into a brand-new house with a new family-a whole new lifestyle. and even though she had wanted to live with dawn and wanted their parents to marry, any big change is hard.  i wish dawn had seen that.  oh, well. great book!  perfect for a funny read. yea!  good book!	1
"after reading the trilogy, i was left wondering what the hell happened? i have just read all 3 of the his dark materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.     pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories i've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. there isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. if you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. from first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just mia for the entire book. spoilers ahead.    what about lyra and her parents? somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? she never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. and will just goes back with mary malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. over a cup of tea, naturally. and that's it for him.  in addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. none of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, will and lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. what happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  and what happened to the `temptation'? was choosing not to stay with will her way of not succumbing to it? the whole premise is just so lame to start out with. as an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give lyra and will a chance to know each other. the flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!    pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. in addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. all of will and lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.     after having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. iorek byrnison, lee scoresby - instead we get page after page about mary malone the disaffected former nun. pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in him or anything for that matter!    this is not children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. it's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. all of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.     we never get closure on lyra's parents.  we never really understand what dust is and where it comes from.  we never see will reunited with his mother.  we get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how.  lyra and will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it.  the mulefa and mary malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. presumably, will goes home, although we never see it. all that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing.  the major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about armageddon? what happened to the fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. it all just sort of disovles.  mary forgot to be the serpent, or else i missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.    another reader pointed out:  "" phillip pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. what a waste of time. i can't believe this book actually won awards. it stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly.""     it would have been better if lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the kingdom of heaven in the course of her lifetime. absurd.  this was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life. series crashes with third book - be warned"	2
eda goldstein does a great job of describing, in detail, ego psychology from a historical, theoretical, and practical perspective. i was particularly fond of part ii dealing with the ego and its functions and defenses. she writes with a clarity that is difficult to find when reading books dealing with detailed theoretical perspectives. i would highly recommend this book to socials workers and pyschologists alike. it is a wealth of information that you will find yourself referencing again and again. eda goldstein & ego psychology	1

"""opium: a history"" by martin booth is an engrossing work of nonfiction that details human reliance on opium for thousands upon thousands of years and how it has affected us physically, emotionally, economically, and morally.    the book starts with a discussion on the poppy flower itself and how opium is derived from the plant's sap and ending on the efforts of international traffickers, government enforcement agencies, and doctors alike in either expanding or eradicating addiction to opium.  in between, you will learn about opium's horrible effects on the body, britain's establishment of the opium trade in china and later efforts to destroy it (counter to the rest of the world's reliance on opium to support their economies), the transformation of opium to heroin, the use of opium to inspire artists around the world, and the quiet and insidious opium trade that goes on with the permission of many governments to support war efforts and other international issues.    to me, the most fascinating thing i learned from this book was the amount of people addicted to the drug in the past because it was such an important painkiller/medicine and because it helped quiet fussy babies.  you can't help finish this book and wonder if it is even possible to win a war against a drug that has shaped the lives of so many humans and so many societies for thousands of years.    i personally found the book easy to read, though i preferred the first two-thirds of the book.  this part of the book covered the drug itself, its health affects, and its early history up to the nineteenth century.  i wasn't as interested in the international trafficking part of the book (the last one-third), probably because so many people, organizations, and countries were mentioned that i lost track of which country was fighting who and who was doing what with heroin or opium.  still, the book is an eye-opening read.  the excruciating description of opium withdrawal should be mandatory reading for high school kids to help stymie any attempt at trying the drug. what you didn't know about opium..."	2
i have been in music industry business for a while now and i would recommand this piece of art to anyone who's new and seriously wants to become familiar with this industry.  whether you're an artist or manager, this book will help you to understand the basics.  i also like the fact that the authors are so honest and give you a real piece of advice if you want to be a successful artist manager, and that is to get education (especially in business).  as a recent business graduate it has helped me to be a lot more successful in this industry. excellent book	1
"i had to purchase this book for a community college class i'm taking.  as a ""textbook,"" it has been a complete disappointment.  the ""science"" is sketchy, the research is shoddy, and the huge holes in logic are brushed over with explanations like ""you can't prove nearly anything empirically in education"" (straight from page 8!).  some of the concepts presented are interesting, but  since mr. jensen (no, he doesn't hold a doctorate) provides almost no citations for his claims, there is no way to check his assertions or determine where the theories come from.  the book reads like a multilevel marketing sales pitch.  in fact, you are encouraged to share it with your friends and colleagues and are directed to a website where you could empty your bank account getting ""certified"" in mr. jensen's unique, ""empirically unproven"" techniques. multilevel marketing meets education"	0
this bible is really great because of the little boxes that explain hard to understand things in the text, and also because it's niv (new international version) so its in plain simple to understand english. if you go to a chistian school and need a good bible for class you should get this it explains everything so well only jesus himself could have said it bette. take it from a teen	1
"i have read this book several times.  he has a clear and logical way of presenting the stages of construction.  his web site is informative and his video is equally as instructive.  in terms of a complete ""how to"" series, i only wish other disciplines were as good.    in addition to the quality of his construction, i am particularly fond of his designs.  most other stitch and glue plans lack the elegance of sam's designs. easy boat building concepts thoroughly explained"	1

i was visiting russia this summer, staying with the grandparents of one of my friends. there was one shelf of books in english in the room where i stayed, and the mind parasites was one of them - i read it in one day, i could not put it down! it was just an amazing book! and since no one who lives in the home where i stayed speaks or reads english, i could have easily just brought the book home with me, but i thought &quot;oh no, i'll just buy my own copy when i get home.&quot;  now i'm kicking myself, hard.  i had no idea the book would be out of print and hard to find!  the copy i read was nice, too.  whoever owned it took good care of their books.  i'm seriously thinking of writing to a friend over there and asking him to go over to the house i stayed in, and get the book so he can send it to me. this book was amazing!	1

i owe my latest payday to jack chapman's negotiating strategies. my newest employer aimed pretty low for their first offer, lower than what i had made at my last job, considering all of the skills and experience i was bringing to the table. but by applying some of the techniques in the book, i was able to get 22% more money. i've never negotiated my salary before: i was just glad someone thought enough of my skills to make me an offer. now, i know better. if you want a bigger paycheck, read this book!	1
i bought this book for our store reference.  my staff became hooked, the information is solid and written in a way that reads like a book built for leisure. one critique;  there could be more pictures in her book, although a cliche - a picture is worth a thousand (descriptive) words.  i will buy more books from ms matlins, she has established herself as the definitive writer for gems and pearls.  thanks for the great reading material.  veronica, ali'i jewelry - hawai. great educational resource!	1
"every so often you read a book that is so obvious that you are amazed you did not see it before. for me, this is such a book. yes, i could argue about the slow nature of the book, about the style or choice of phrase. however, the very simple idea (singular) at the core hit me like a billiard ball between the eyes at three paces.    de bono takes the idea of thinking, and breaks it down into six different aspects, and proposes that all should be allowed at appropriate times in a meeting. the key is not that (say) raw emotion can be expressed unjustified, but that where necessary such feelings are not only encouraged, but that it is an everybody thing. participants are allowed to express a simple yes / no to an idea with no further comments. this, by the way, is `red hat thinking'.    each aspect of thinking is given a colour, so participants will wear the same hat at the same time, to view topics from a similar perspective. there is no compelling reason to have physical hats, but presumably this may help initially. examining each proposal in a critical way is allowed, but not all the way through any discussion - only at `blackhat' time.    this is a short, easy-read book. it would be possible to give a summary here of the six hats, and their meanings - however, it is better to let de bono do that. chapters are small and bite-sized, with an introduction and summary to each coloured hat. you do not need to read the book in one sitting, but it is probably advisable to tackle the 170 pages within 2 or 3 days.    the author has written a number of other books on `thinking', and these are referred to in the text of the volume. for me, the references were about right - neither too many (a sales pitch) or too few (not giving readers the opportunity to get further information). what did irritate me was the summary chapters for each hat, where the majority of sentences seemed to begin with e.g. ""blue hat thinking ....."".    at the end de bone gives a possible framework for using the principles within a meeting. this is helpful, and adds to the comments and examples throughout the text. the overall feel is that this is a book about thinking that is based in reality.      my final thoughts concern interminable meetings i have attended, and national flags. use of the core idea of this thin volume would have saved man-months of my time, sometimes concluding that a meeting was not necessary. the national flag theme? take a south african flag into meetings with you. this will remind you of the thinking hats, for the colours are the same.    buy it, learn it, practice it, and do it.    peter morgan, bath, uk (morganp@supanet.com). de bono will make you think"	2
i can remember telling people to leave me alone in the lunch room as i read through the final quarter of this book. while this book does feature some hannibal lecter moments, it is more centered around the search for a serial killer, with hannibal once again providing the 'consultant' role. the movie did a fairly sucessful job with this up until the end, which was saddening; the ending in this book is quite a powerhouse, although similar in them. this is a very compelling read whether you are a horror fan or crime fan. there is alot of technical forensic stuff here and there, but it works well as you follow the closing in on a really sick guy. the romance element here is quite strong and tragic; it provides a nice distraction from the constant tension you feel throughout these pages. i was very impressed with this book, and it had me hanging on every last word. i can't imagine anyone who likes this kind of stuff feeling any differently. a real page turner	1
"i bought this book, hoping it would go farther than getting into the ""front door"" of dming.  i kept reading, telling myself, no it is going to go into depth, it is going to hit on some substance, but it never did.     it spends too much of its time, focusing on the ""dummy"" concept.  it repeats itself over and over again, stating ""you are the dm, you are the one that runs the game"".  yes i know that, now get on with the book, i kept saying!    if you are a totally new dm, then this book will be helpful.  if you have run a game, a couple of times, then you have probably already figured out all of the concepts mentioned here. just not enough...very very basic!"	2

before i read the last 100 pages of this book, i would have given it 3 stars.  woken furies suffers from a common affliction among many sci-fi series: same-samey-ness.  once you're introduced to the world, the technologies, the aliens, whatever, unless the author can keep the creative curve balls coming (peter hamilton often has the ability to keep things fresh), the joy and surprise of discovery quickly fades.  and so it goes with woken furies.  two thirds of the way through and i thought harlan's world just wasn't different enough from venice beach to keep me riveted.  and assembling the decom team, going into battle, using the cybertech - i might as well have been re-reading broken angels, morgan's best by far.    but!  just when i was resigned my disappointment, the last few chapters cranked the book out of its nose dive.  morgan lets loose with some big ideas, and the final showdown is spectacular fun.  sci-fi writers often have problems ending their books (stephenson, gibson anyone?), but morgan always ends with a satisfying crunch, and this one wrapped up the nicest of them all.   a word of warning - this is by far the most violent book i have ever read, and that includes morgan's previous books.  if you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen.  and morgan's graphic sex scenes seem gratuitous and perfunctory to the point of being boring porn.    in morgan's favor, as usual his prose is taut as a drum and hits hard.  characterization has always been his strong point, and this is perhaps his best: kovacs's anger seethes off every page.  the self-loathing loose cannon may be a cliché, but with kovacs you can feel it, to the point where character is basically a psychotic serial-killer, and you're right there with him.  i think morgan was wise to retire kovacs with this novel.  one more and the sameyness would have made the series a bore.  (i've given up on hamilton and reynolds for that reason - i get it already.)  if you're a fan of the kovacs books, this is definitely worth some tedium (albeit entertaining tedium) to get to the payoff.  i'm looking forward to what morgan will do next. worth the payoff at the end	2
"david levithan's newest novel, ""wide awake,"" is a political novel set ""in the near future."" here's the set up:    ""the greater depression happened. the events of 3/12 and 7/23 happened. the andreas quake and hurricane wanda. the president launched his war to end all wars, which only managed to create more wars and the tragic events of 4/5. the greater depression deepened. millions of people died, and there was no way to erase their faces from the more renegade open news channels, which wanted to remind everyone how bad the government had let things get. the decents and their program of denial education reached their peak.""    the hero and narrator of ""wide awake"" is a jewish, gay teen named duncan who is engaged politically for the first time in his life. after all the troubles of his childhood and the generation(s) before, it seems as if a new era is on the horizon. his presidential candidate, abraham stein, a jewish gay man with a partner and children, has been elected. people are behaving differently, celebrating their ethnic, cultural, and sexual differences. and supporting them all is a sizable group of jesus freaks.    ""for the jesus revolutionaries, the answer was clear: jesus would not be out waging ""preventative"" wars. jesus would not be withholding medicine from people who could not afford it. jesus would not cast stone at people of races, sexual orientations, or genders other than his own. jesus would not condone the failing, viperous, scandal-plagued hierarchy of some churches. jesus would welcome everyone to his table. he would love them, and he would find peace.""    sounds like a utopian novel so far, right? but there's a hitch. a hitch in the form of kansas. stein's election is being contested. to the tune of 1,000 votes. (sound familiar?) stein calls all his supporters to kansas and duncan and his friends head to topeka to support their candidate.    while ""wide awake"" is a political novel, levithan does not abandon the everyday. duncan struggles in his relationship with gorgeous jimmy, teachers can be kind or belligerent, parents are sometimes more conservative than you'd like, and friends take sides in everyday breakups. but, in the end, levithan's message is one of hope. people can be good and good people can change even the worst-case scenario into a better present and future.    ""wide awake"" is for older teens, ages 15 and up. for the politically-oriented teen"	1

"""let us be willing to test our spiritual experiences and evangelistic practices by scripture,"" pastor will metzger implores (51). regrettably, pastor metzger was loathe to follow his own sound advice, opting instead to test his and the rest of christendom's spiritual experiences and evangelistic practices by the standards laid down so long ago in the westminster confession of faith (1646). and that is the main reason this latest revised and expanded edition of his ironically titled tell the truth (downers grove, ill.: intervarsity press, 2002) remains a wealth of hyper-calvinistic misinformation.         twenty-one years after the first printing of tell the truth (hereafter, ttt), pastor metzger remains deeply troubled that increasingly cynical christendom is still attempting to evangelize the unbelieving world by showing only the attractive parts of the gospel message, and as a result are creating a vast army of god-damned (literally) pseudo-converts. pastor will, who began his career as a campus minister on the staff of intervarsity christian fellowship at the university of delaware the same year sir winston churchill departed for his eternal reward (1965), believes a return to ""biblical evangelism"" can reverse the curse of ""me-centered"" evangelism (38). and so ttt attempts to remedy the current sorry situation by explaining fully the content of the gospel (part 1: pp. 23-86); insuring that gospel message converts intellect, emotions, and will, i.e. the entire soul (part 2: pp. 87-111); explaining proper calvinistic soteriology (part 3: 112-158); and learning how to competently defend and communicate the faith (part 4: 159-207). if for some reason the reader feels the need to have the main points of ttt rehearsed and/or get some idea how they might be put to good use in the real world, pastor metzger offers appendixes a-d (pp. 208-259).           in pastor metzger's considered (read: reformed church tradition) opinion, the numerous miracles performed by 1st century a.d. evangelists in the book of acts may be hanged, because there are really only two ways to proclaim christ: ""the airplane of christian witness has two wings: our lives (conduct) and our lips (conversation)"" (25). strangely, pastor metzger offers no scriptural reference(s) to buttress this rather sweeping claim. the omission is particularly glaring given the bitterness of the complaint he voices in ttt's introductory chapter: ""why is there such reticence to examine the biblical basis for methods of witness (especially if they are the ones our church uses)?"" (17). the irony is already palpable.         just a few pages later pastor metzger folds and tucks away one of his two wings of christian witness, observing that numerous religious persuasions and philosophies will also produce positive, observable changes in conduct capable of impressing others (28). but a few pages later the wing is reopened by pastor metzger, who now declares new converts may safely conclude they are truly saved when ""they see the fruits of a changing life"" (38). fine.         pastor metzger next reminds that ""in the book of acts we see the apostles as teachers--reasoning, persuading, explaining--involved in all sorts of teaching activity in order to communicate as much truth as possible to nonbelievers"" (34). unfortunately pastor metzger omits the fact that secularists, mormons, jehovah's witnesses, and numerous other cult leaders are also actively engaged as teachers--reasoning, persuading, explaining--involved in all sorts of teaching activity in order to communicate as much ""truth"" as possible to nonbelievers. the all-important difference is that unlike these false witnesses of god, the apostles were able to perform many wonders and signs (acts 2:43). those signs and wonders authenticated the apostles' divine bona fides, just as they had previously authenticated jesus christ's divine bona fides, and the divine bona fides of the true prophets' of the ot before him.          (where exactly in the nt did pastor metzger read that god would go into semi-retirement immediately after giving the apostle john a revelation of the future? where?)         pastor metzger spends the rest of part one differentiating between ""me-centered evangelism,"" i.e., spreading christianity by emphasizing the many personal benefits that will attend salvation, and ""biblical evangelism,"" i.e. five-point calvinism. ""conversion is both a turning from and a turning toward"" pastor metzger insists (67-68). ""both law and love are basic ingredients in telling the gospel story"" pastor m. admonishes (71). consciences need to be pricked. people must be made to understand that they do not have proprietary rights to their own lives, god does.         pastor m. is not keen on encouraging new converts to make a public confession of their faith, ala romans 10:9-10. he thinks they should be left alone to meditate on scriptures like isaiah 53, psalm 51, and galatians 2:20 (76). apparently never having read acts 16:31 or philippians 2:11, pastor m. declares ""there is not one exhortation in scripture to `accept christ as lord,'"" (77).         on page 79 pastor m. lists three ways to know you are saved. the first is when you ""trust in the promises of god as being promises to you."" the second is ""a change in your attitude and actions corresponding to the fruit of the spirit (gal 5) and the marks of salvation (1 jn)"" (pastor m. ignores his earlier observation that new agers can also experience profound attitude changes). the third assurance of salvation is ""the inner witness of god's spirit to your spirit."" pastor m. does not unpack that statement, leaving it to the reader to exegete what he will from it. by marked contrast, the gospel writer mark recorded jesus' decidedly different criteria for determining who is saved:     and these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well. (16:17-18).         part two tries to distinguish professors of christianity from possessors of same in order to increase more of the latter. conversion is a process, not an event pastor m. cautions. christianity is not a self improvement plan; it is god's method for restoring you to fellowship with him. converts need ""to ask god for faith,"" since ""they are not choosing to be saved"" (91). pastor m. then presents a short, biased analysis of the age-old arminian-calvinism debate on soteriology, concluding that the five points of calvinism are ""orthodox theology ... in need of further filling out"" (109).          part three, ""wholly by grace,"" is largely a continuation of the calvinist rant begun in part two. pastor m. admits the arbitrary election of a relative handful to heaven and the overwhelming majority to hell is not fair, but hey, god is sovereign, and he would have been justified to throw everyone in hell, not just almost everyone. humanity's free will has been disabled by sin, and now it cannot choose anything but sin (if that is true, and doing right is not an option, how could sin then be termed a ""choice?""). ""god hides the truth from some people. he doesn't reveal himself or jesus to them. why (lk 10:21-22)?"" (146). pastor m. misinterprets that passage in luke to mean intelligent people are tricked into unbelief by a vengeful or capricious god, as opposed to them being deserving victims of their own misplaced self-confidence.         part four begins by enumerating some of the difficulties philosophical pluralism creates for successful evangelism. pastor m. defends christian exclusivity by referring to john 14:6: jesus answered, ""i am the way and the truth and the life. no one comes to the father except through me.""  pastor m. ignores the fact that jesus' comments were offered to his own disciples at a private gathering, not addressed to the masses in general during a public sermon.         pastor m. observes all religious faiths save christianity require its adherents ""to do something"" (165). pastor m. apparently has not noticed that repenting, confessing, baptizing, trusting, etc., are verbs.         pastor m. believes the evangelistic value of christian apologetics is limited. ""god's chosen instrument in conversion is his word, not our reasoning ability"" (169). in that case we can only pity that great swath of humanity that was never taught how to read, or could never afford to purchase a copy of scripture, or never had the word translated into their native tongue.         pastor m. soon changes his mind about god's chosen instrument in conversion. ""prayer for others is the supreme god ordained method in evangelism"" (178) as usual, pastor m. offers no scriptural support for his emphatic, sweeping statement. he goes on to say ""evangelism is asking the right questions"" (189), but once again cites no nt anecdote to support his contention. besides asking all the right questions, the christian evangelist also needs to make sure an unbeliever understands ""the impossibility of ... exercising faith on their own"" (203). fine.         in summary, tell the truth proffers a pneumatology, a soteriology, and a strategy for evangelism that seems alien to those described in the book of acts. when all is said and done, ttt is hoisted by its own petard: ""... to be unwilling to evaluate our evangelism in the light of the bible is to not take scripture seriously"" (19). obscure the truth"	0
written by frank miller and hauntingly illustrated by david mazzucchelli, year one was serialized in batman #404-407.    it tells of the first calendar year in which batman emerged in gotham city, beginning with bruce wayne returning to gotham after studying martial arts abroad. wayne becomes a vigilante, at first without the batman outfit, at first fumbling a bit.  the sequence in which he conceives of the outfit takes the old cliché from batman history of a bat crashing through the window and transforms it into a moving moment; year one gives similar treatment to flashbacks showing the murder of wayne's parents.  in a city dominated by gangsters before the ascent of insane costumed criminals, batman encounters catwoman, here depicted as a whore who takes to the street with frustrations about gender, her sadomasochistic elements heightened.  james gordon becomes a fully-realized character for the first time, adjusting from his move from chicago to gotham, where the police force is dominated by corruption.  he investigates batman, suspects wayne, has an affair, and ultimately has his child kidnapped and rescued by the vigilante he sought to bring down.  in a tough city, he goes from crusader against batman to the first stages of his relationship with batman.    a masterful work, batman:  year one possesses a level of realism greater than perhaps any batman tale and, with a breakneck pace, does the hard work of describing the humble beginnings of batman's career, performing in the process a remarkable process of infusing bruce wayne, james gordon, and selina kyle with true character, personality, and history.    this is the second best batman story ever made, second only (perhaps) to the dark knight returns.    -- julian darius, sequart.com (for sophisticated study of comic books and graphic novels. an absolute classic	1
whether you've already used up the previous two spanish guides in the practice makes perfect series (spanish verb tenses, and spanish pronouns and pronouns), or this is your introduction, this workbook is as good as it gets for the intermediate to advanced student of spanish who wants to keep learning beyond the classroom. complete spanish grammar has it all--friendly, down-to-earth language, exercises that could have been taken right out of hispanic shops and streets and living rooms, and explanations of grammar components that actually make sense.   i don't know how many times i've heard the exact phrases i just saw in the workbook while walking down the streets of mexican towns. and since it's soft-cover, it's easy to take with you and work with while traveling. hey, at $10.95, you can even afford to buy and extra one to keep in the car. better than barron's	1
open theism is just another form of socininism that exists to avoid predestination. sinful man longs to be master of his fate and the determiner of future events. thus the theology that god wills as man wills. god is man's toady and his task is to bring hapiness and success to his creatures. in return,maybe sinners will give him some love. so let all men be liars,and god be true. just another heresy	0
"women in america are so fun to be with, so wonderful, and so full of life, it's sad the men in this country haven't taken notice of them.  this book points the finger where it is needed most - at the menfolk!    while we do face a 43% divorce rate and a 17% separation rate in this country with 65+% of those divorces and separations initiated by the wives of those marriages, and women are overwhelmingly favored to receive alimony and child support over men in family court, this should be of no concern to men.    oh, and also if you have a woman in your home or are married to her for a short while, you may be liable for a huge amount of palimony or alimony.    oh, and evidentiary due process is not required for you to be convicted of domestic violence in family court.  you may end up losing your children, house, bank account and freedom if your wife decides she is bored and wants to ""move on"".    uhhh, never mind... women good, men bad"	2
nicola writes in such a spare and poetic style that she must capture the imagination of each child who reads it, or has it read to her. she offers facts about this bat breed as she weaves her story, and topped with delicate artwork, it's just perfect. i love this book	1
the colors and shapes book is a very useful tool for learning the basics of spanish. if you want something that is easy to read and understand, this is your book. from reading this book, i think anyone would be able to learn the basic colors and shapes in both english and spanish. my favorite part was the last page which was a picture of a colorful room full of shapes. this was a good exercise to wrap up the book and apply the words that i learned. a child would be able to use this book, and others like it in the series, to learn and then apply knowledge in every day life when seeing colors and shapes of any kind. this book doesn't just stick to simple shapes such as circle and square, but also includes words for diamond, sphere, and cone. colors and shapes	1
it is because of this book and the other books james fetzer wrote with his dishonest pack, that people have lost so much interest in the jfk assassination. honest authors like harold weisberg and david wrone attract less attention because they only published what they could prove and not what they dream up. the z-film was altered, many know this, the warren commission published it in volume 18 (18h1-84) with frames missing. in case you don't know this, that counts as alteration. z-film tampering was not to the extent that fetzer claims such as painting jackie's face on the film itself. the film was not stolen, or doctored up in anyway. no one would be dumb enough to take that risk. wast of money	0
this book does not include plates of birds that are included in peterson field guides from western north america, eastern north america or texas. so, unless you have their guide books memorized for these locations, the mexico guide book is basically useless. alternatively, you could buy all four books  (eastern na, western na, texas, and mexico) and carry them all with you. or you could just purchase a different, stand-alone guide book with plates of the most or all of the birds in the region. close to useless	0

i'm a big fan of shogun (4 1/2 stars) and tai-pan (4 stars) and expected much of the same here.  but after 450 pages i gave up.  plot, subplot, sub-subplot, sub-sub-subplot, scores of characters.  i got tired of starting another chapter with a new plot angle, when i was ready for development and resolution of what came before.    this book picks up with the straun/brock rivalry from tai-pan after an interval of 120 years.  i wanted that history filled-in (including the remaining three coins), but there was little of that in what i read.     the writing is still good and i may have been impatient to quit after only a third of the book, but i had to move on to something more satisfying. endless plotting	2
this book was selected as a biography for a 5th grader. both my child and i felt the book was too cluttered with side bars of historical events and distracting projects. trying to find information about da vinci's life proved elusive. there was no infomation on his childhood, but most  glaringly was the lack of information about his skills as a mathematician  or astromner.  the focus was on his artistic ability, yet there were few  pictures of his most famous works. the book did provide infomation, but in  a rather boring and cluttered manner. this book is satisfactory as  secondary reference. my child, an avid reader, did not enjoy this book. he  said it was not for kids. leonardo da vinci for kids : his life and ideas.	2

martha grimes has had a good thing going with the richard jury series, until now.  bizarre is too interesting a word to use for this book.  more like muddled, drawn out, and difficult.  the story within a story is an intriguing idea, but it went nowhere.  the plot is weak, the characters' actions unbelievable, and the ending disappointing.  i have enjoyed reading this series, but to be honest, this book was a waste of time.  i think it's time for jury, plant, and pals to be put to rest. enough	0
"maggie is a professor of history at somerset county community college, but she toils during her time off working on her antique business where she specializes in rare prints.  right now maggie is attending a social function being given by dorothy and oliver whitcomb, major contributors to the college and the moving force behind whitcomb house, a dormitory for unwed single parents and their children.  the six lively students have their fees, book and any incidentals including childcare paid for.    the six students are also at the party but sarah becomes ill and falls into a coma; she is rushed to the hospital where the doctors discover she was poisoned.  they believe there was nicotine in the spicy drink she was having.  a couple of days later another student is poisoned and is found in the house by one of the children.  tiffany was wilder than sarah was and some of the mothers believe she was blackmailing someone.  the case becomes personal when maggie's office is trashed and someone tries to break into her home.  to save whitcomb house maggie decides to see if she can discover who the killer really is.    shadows on the ivy is very different from the other ""antique mystery"" book because this story concentrates on the heroine's life as a professor while the other works showcased the protagonist as an antique print dealer.  thus, this novel displays a completely different side of maggie that readers will like.  lea wait has written an exciting and entertaining academic mystery that provides a whole different meaning to study time.    harriet klausner. entertaining academic mystery "	1
i was in search of a good figure drawing book with an emphasis on animation and comics and this one caught my eye. after reading through, practicing the techniques and understanding them, i'm convinced that this is the most invaluable book i have in my large collection of art books.    this book completely changed the way i draw. i've been drawing seriously for roughly 10 years and once the ideas in this book clicked, it made me feel as if i'd been drawing the wrong way for all those years. well worth the 17 bucks or whatever it was i payed for it.    i wouldn't recommend this book to beginners however. it's not really a how to draw or a book that covers basic proportion and anatomy issues. for somebody to get the most out of this book, i think they'd need to have a solid grasp on anatomy and fundamental drawing techniques. on the other hand, a beginner may benefit from this book simply from a gesture standpoint.    easily a 5 out of 5 for me. invaluable!	1
i had to read this book for my highschool literature class. now i enjoy reading a good book now and then but the only reason that this is a bestseller is that all highschools across america must buy the book for summer reading every year. this book put me to sleep. the only reason this book gets two stars is because of the trojan war chapter which i wished was longer. it was rich in detail and made you want to keep reading, unlike the rest of the book. i only recommend this book if you have to for a school class but other than that don't waste your time. bestseller?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!	2
i just didn't like this book. i wanted to put it down and not pick it up ever again, but once i start reading a book i have to finsh it. first she was trying to run away from her past, then i dont know why her husband stayed with her. she made me sick and i liked her sister more than her. i was kind of hoping that her husband would have left her for her sister instead of staying with her. eric jerome dickey has been slipping in his last few books i hope the next two coming out this year will be better.  ashley. i hated it	2

the book gives a thorough insight into the making of the most ambitious remaking of roman epic in the 21st century hollywood crowd of sci-fi movies. the pictures and the conceptual sketches really give additional values to the book in satisfying the artistic curiosity of the movie fans. the only drawback is that they didn't put in the complete shooting script a la other pictorial newmarket movie books. a tour de force of roman epic	2
"lord jim is the story of an ordinary man who commits what may or may not be an act of cowardice and spends the rest of his life trying to atone for his sin.  what makes this story extraordinary is the difficulty the reader has assessing the nature of the original act and then judging whether jim has been punished enough.  joseph conrad does not make it easy to gauge accurately either the man or his act since we can see the act filtered only through the lens of a narrator who is too close to the case to be judged reliable.    lord jim is a novel of adventure and many read it on that basis, but lurking beneath the surface of a simple act is, as in so much of conrad's fiction, a bewildering complexity of issues that tap into the deepest recesses of why people do what they do and how others can fairly judge them.  marlow is the narrator who attends the trial of a crewman jim accused of abandoning his ship during a storm when he thought it was sinking. when all the ship's officers leap into a lifeboat they abandon the more than eight hundred passengers below decks. jim joins them, and all are later picked up by a french trawler only to learn that their ship did not sink and in fact was safely towed to port.  all the officers, except jim, escape punishment either by running away or pleading illness.  only jim decides to speak out publicly in his defense, but of course there is none, so he is found guilty and stripped of his seaman's certificate as punishment.  marlow sees the trial and decides to follow jim around the world to get the truth. these are the bald facts, but what conrad does with them is to invest them with emotional and psychological issues that resist easy analysis.     to begin with, conrad emphasizes jim's ordinary state of being, by repeating that jim is ""one of us."" this statement occurs so often that it becomes a mantra, inviting speculation as to what sense he is one of us. whoever the ""us"" is, conrad implies that the ""us"" must have had a standard of justice in which one size fits all.  no one at the board of inquiry seems particularly upset that jim was merely following the captain's orders to abandon ship nor that his record was otherwise flawless. the board judged jim by an inflexible code of honor and found him wanting. conrad, in his description of jim as a maritime everyman (no first name, a flat character who no past, present, and now no future), makes it easy to condemn the board's overhasty verdict to condemn jim for an act that had mitigating circumstances.  as marlow gets to know jim, he acknowledges that the more he knows, the less he understands.  conrad sets up a straw man in jim. because so many people, including marlow, hold jim under so many lenses, the images that result are often contradictory.  the only constant is jim himself.  during the trial, and later during the climactic encounter with the natives who call him lord jim, jim continues to attempt to see himself in the simplest manner possible. he knows that he cannot possibly be all the jims floating on everyone's lips, so he determines to be the jim who should have stayed on board the deck of a sinking ship.  this jim is willing to take responsibility for his actions.  when he unwisely allows the dastardly gentleman brown to escape his richly deserved fate, he makes a colossal leap of faith: he will pay now for all sins of his past.  in his death, conrad suggests that this leap of faith may be the only trait that distinguishes reprobates like brown from ordinary men like jim who may not be so ordinary after all. lord jim: through many prisms darkly"	2
i bought this book thinking that it might be more than the usual time line history that so many other writers have produced. i was bitterly disappointed. nothing new to add to the history of the band and really quite a bland read. as someone who knows that there was more to the 'lads' than what has been previously written, i was expecting more insight into their lives, more accurate information, and basically just more. the title of the book is quite misleading, as the only babylon that seemed to go on was tam's alledged chasing of pat around hotel rooms and one recalled incident of les and a mate hiding 2 groupies on a freezing balcony. if you know anything about the rollers, you don't need to buy this book in hopes of learning more. it simply isn't there. a huge disappointment for this long time roller fan. nothing new 	0
"i am reading the book ""the westing game"" and i say that this book absolutely awful.  the book has very little details, and the plot is oh, so boring, and i never like this before. the characters names are pointlessly appropriate such as ""crow"", ""turtle', and ""uncle sam"". the scenery is bad, and i could imagine better places. the ending was also absolutely terrible in all ways ever. i would rather drink tea from a gutter then read this book again.   the book starts as a pointless scenario and progress to a field of writing horror. i think the author had a huge writers block, and wrote down what ever she could think of first. i don't now how, but newbery award. i would have slapped a biohazard sticker to the book just to so how i really think of this book. my summary is that this book is extremely terrible, and should be destroyed. the westing game"	2

cut-paper play is an excellent collection of over 80 kid-approved construction paper creations for children ages 4 to 10. the projects are grouped by 3 different skill and difficulty levels. a variety of techniques  is shown. all you need is different kinds of paper or cardboard, scissors,  glue, sometimes yarn or a stapler. so the crafts are inexpensive, but very  amazing. two- and  three-dimensional projects, mobiles and seasonal  projects are shown. we got inspiration for many more paper projects for the  future. fun with construction paper creations	1
i am a recent subscriber to the magazine, so i was drawn to the book by it's truly amazing photos.  the garden definitions at the beginning of each section were a nice addition, too.  i do wish, however, it had just a bit  more content.  it is inspiring to leaf through, and dream. beautiful, but...?	2
this isn't an introductory book on quarks. it assumes you already know the terminology. what is spin? what is isospin? the glossary at the back isn't helpful. i read 20 or so pages and then realized it wasn't an oversight... he really has no plans to introduce these and other basic terms and explain them. very disappointing. assumes you already know quark terminology	2
this is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by ufos no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. the strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. his utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. i give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it. creepy	2
i was in the mood for an fast entertaining read, and this book filled the bill. actually, i read it years ago, and recently re-read it.  it's suspenseful with a nice touch of romance.  i am not going to argue with other posters who say the characters were not fleshed out or the plot was unbelievable.  i enjoyed the story and the resourcefulness of the characters, and the constant sense of impending danger.  i wasn't looking for a literary exploration of the human condition, just a fun read with likable characters and a fast-paced plot, and this is it. entertaining read	2

what a treat to have this updated version of the author's classic history of boston. the photos still resonate with the sadness of their loss and the beauty of their existence. but this isn't just a coffee table book. it remains the best history of this fascinating old, and new, city. i especially liked the supplement telling what had been saved, what was threatened and what was lost. i bought the first version 20 years ago and have bought the second to give to the next generation in my household to say how cities grow and should grow. a splendid book. a peak at the past...and present	1
i saw the movie, i knew the story, but nothing could have prepared me for this account of it all.  the different parts of the whole scandal, all the involved people from rothstein to gandil, this book is full of detail.  i could not put it down as i wanted to keep learning more and more about what happened and why these players corrupted the game.  i started to sympathize for them even though what they did was wrong.  they were being cheated by comiskey and there was no way around that. well you can read it to find out how and learn more about the scandal as it unfolds. simply amazing	1
a good beginner's book for those interested in building their own speakers without getting into heavy mathematics, passive electronics, complex woodworking, or folded horns. the book explains some the rudiments of  speaker theory, and barely enough to design your own simple crossover  network.  the book has several economical projects which the author already  debugged and are ready to build, including: the make and model of the  speakers, list of passive components, schematic - which usually include  extras like a zobel network, and the cabinet dimensions.  their are several  two-way projects and one three-way with a ten-inch woofer.  most designs  use a soft-dome tweeter, if that's what you like.  there is a list of raw  component vendors in the back of the book. the designs for the ported boxes  use the thiel method, and i am finding that this may be conservatively  sized toward the large side with respect to a flat bass response.  the  prose is a bit wordy, but still easy to read.  overall, i have learned a  few things from this book. ok for starters.	2
"what on earth did everyone else read?!?....this book isn't even worth 0.1 of a star. it's terrible! i'm pretty sure 20c mass produced romance novels are better than this drivel. i'm not really a fan of historical fiction, but it was given to me as a present so i felt i had to read it. the 'plot' is terrible. none of the characters have any depth or any real storyline.     our protagonist, if you can call him that; nicolas, only has one trick up his sleeve to ""plough"" his girls...a tale about how a unicorn's horn makes everything pure. he then sets about trying to sleep with basically any girl over 12. there's a bit of talk here and there about tapestries...but  i think a primary school course in art history can give you more meaningful information than this book. the story is complete nonsense and very poorly expressed and to be honest with you, i cannot believe it ever got published, let alone sold and read. umm..did i read the same book as everyone else?"	0
margaret abraham has poured an enormous effort into sorting out the various dynamics, both above the surface and well below, of the discourse centering on the plight of south asian women coming to the united states.  it is to her credit that her research has such size and substance yet provides compelling reading, with implications for many other areas of scholarship, including feminist theory.  her narrative, rich as it is in detail from the interviews she conducted, has to do with discerning ways that scholars document brutal secrets existing in an extremely contested discourse, not that of assigning some kind of victimhood.  this is an important work on a difficult topic.  a must read. extraordinary insight into an extremely contested discourse	1
i got this book from my grandma when i was 6. i'm 20 now and realize what an awful story this is! this little rabbit gets a special gift of red cardinal's wings, which seemed awesome to me as a kid,  and his own mother and family reject him because he's wierd! a great book for homophobic parents or anyone else who wants their kid to know that being different is bad and if you are different, even your own parents will turn you away. i'm just glad i read more shel silverstein poems than i did trash like this. read it as a child - horrible morals	0

this text will be a chore to read for most american students who are new to gis.  although the author(s) manage to cram alot of information into the relatively short chapters, the sentences are long and difficult to understand because of the overly wordy, jargon-filled 'proper' use of british english &amp; spellings.  if you decide to purchase this book, then i highly recommend the 'oxford unabridged english dictionary' to go along with it.  the majority of the students in my class &quot;geographic information systems i&quot; at southwest texas state university, which has one of the best geography programs in the nation, felt the same way i do, and also thought that the book was too advanced for an introductory gis class.  i think that the professors at southwest texas state university are now using a different text for that class.  also, people always complain that books tend to be geared toward a single software program- well, like it or not, in the united states, esri has a monopoly on geographic software so you are going to have to learn arcview/info one way or another. american readers/students look elsewhere	2
i have some of ehlert's other books and have found them to be wonderful, however, i found that this book was so very negative and had some very terrible concepts in it.  although the author portrayed activities that cats do, i was shocked to see them so boldly described in a children's book.  i teach preschoolers and would not want to read this book to my class. i was disappointed	0
getting ready to go on international assignment, i picked up a copy of this book. the author's breathless inanities ran along the lines of (a paraphrase), &quot;wow, some british men used to wear bowler hats.&quot; i found very little useful in this book to prepare me for the transition, and was occasionally offended by his borderlne racist generalizations. i was expecting sociology and got sleaze instead. a painful read	0

a sad commentary on our society that only the audio versions of this book are available. with the increase of interest in the first world war recently it is to this book that many people should turn for a gripping, factual account of life before, during and after the great war. mr graves documents the pastoral quiet of england in the early part of the twentieth century and abruptly descends to recounting, in cold detail, the dreadful slaughter of the trenches. through some of the most famous battles in history he survives, physically more or less intact but from the dry words; modest, english, reserved, we glimpse the true weight of the burden that such memories impose on their carriers and understand better the terrible toll that the war levied on all the nations of europe. compulsory reading for every politician.	1
"i give this outing of the amelia peabody emerson novels five stars simply because it was a heck of a good story, a thrilling ride, and the ending came out of blue. as with the last few books in this series the violence directed at the emerson family becomes more dangerous than it ever has been. people are being shot, prostitutes are murdered, and members of the emerson clan are put in extreme, dangerous positions. what the author seems to be doing is showing what a family living in and working in egypt might have to deal withat this point in history: egyptian nationalistic movements, british prejudices, and the rumblings of wwi (minus the mystery high-jixs and master criminals, of course). the one annoying factor in this novel was nefret. the author has chosen to take a once strong and intelligent young woman and turn her into a petty, childish, lovelorn twit who not only makes bad choices that put the family in greater danger, but also breaks the heart of nearly every member of the family. ramses also had his annoying moments.  he has always been a favorite character, but since attaining adulthood he's become a brooding, self-righteous, and insulting young man with a real ""superman"" syndrome. again, i'm allowing myself to become too invested in the lives of fictional characters, but that's the hallmark of a great author. one of the bright spots and little used aspects of this novel is david and his new wife lia. much of this novel revolves around accusations against david and his late grandfather, abdullah, so i wish he could have played a larger role, but he does become a major focal point of the novel near the end. i just wish the author would allow this character to step into the limelight more instead of being little more than ramses' shadow. overall, this was an exciting and thrilling edition of the emerson clan adventures and i strongly recommend the novel. an exciting and thrilling read"	1
"this story of a football team illustrates a much more profound element of human psychology - how to handle success.  whether success is a relationship, career, business, or any other endeavor, the lessons here are to be heeded or the result will invariably be the same.    to put this in context, the 1985 chicago bears football team is arguably the best ever assembled in the modern era.  while other teams may have had more success over time, or had 1 less loss, this team is widely regarded as the most dominating.  in addition to the on-the-field success, the team created media stars like mike ditka, jim mcmahan and ""the fridge"", along with established all time greats like walter payton, mike singletary and dan hampton.    so what happened? how did it blow up so fast?  a classic tale of forgetting to continue what made you successful in the first place.      the players and the team became successful by playing harder, and using an almost desperate intensity to how they played the game from a play design perspective to personal and individual motivation.  at first this focus (the 46 defense, the frenetic play style) took the league by surprise and gave them a decided advantage, but like most of us with any kind of success, once it was achieved they forgot to keep changing to adapt to the world they created.  in addition, they succumbed to the temptation of starting to believe their own press, and became infatuated with their own greatness.  once that happens, it slips away quickly.  the detail behind the strategy success and infighting that eroded the spirit of the team, are depicted clearly.    after reading this book, which is full of delicious insights and salacious comments amongst the team about each other, it is hard to find where to place the blame.  everyone seemed so wrapped up in the media circus that they all seemed to drift away from the mission.    for the football fan, this is a great book, full of strategic detail and player reactions.  for the person who wants to better understand the dynamics of how to keep themselves or their organization from getting too full of themselves and their success, the lessons here are easy to see, though often difficult to avoid.    the book is written exceptionally well, in that it flows easily, is always interesting, follows a nice chronological progressions, and does what it intends - describe the amazing success and quick burn out of perhaps the greatest football team ever assembled. why is greatness so hard to maintain?  find out here.."	2

this very complete volume is a lovely gift book as well as a useful reference book.  the only weakness is the lack of emphasis on arm positions when doing the steps although they are illustrated in the photographs.  i believe dancers who have experienced the following will find it useful too:  when i was a student of ballet, i was frustrated by the subtle differences in the standards of different teachers.  sometimes i wondered, &quot;so how exactly am i supposed to do this?&quot;  i did not enjoy being corrected for what a prior instructor had taught me and pronounced well-executed.  this book would have clarified things for me at the time.  now that i practice alone, i find this book invaluable.    also, i support christine's review dated may 4, 2001. a useful reference book	2
this will appeal to many people, from history buffs to health professionals and those of us who also love a good story. myself, i always enjoy the human behavior aspect to how things came to be in our society, and the story of vaccination is terrific. aside from the fun aspect of this book, mr. allen manages to write compassionately about the real people who have believed that their children's autism was caused by vaccines. there has been so much propaganda and spurious argumentation around this issue (particularly by people like don imus--he should be ashamed of himself), which has unfortunately lead many parents of children with autism to believe that vaccination caused their child's disability. i hope very much that mr. allen's work will help shine the light of reason on that sad situation. very enjoyable with an important message	1
"i've read and often re-read most every pj book and column ever written. i've always liked this guy. i keep his books after i've read them instead of taking them to the local used book store.  ""on the wealth of nations"" did not work. honestly, it sort of skidded into a ditch and got stuck from page one. it reads like the meeting minutes of a local book club. it's not so much pj, it's the concept of taking possibly one of the country's biggest early day doorstops of a read and then having a top-end writer in the 21st century translate it with some political satire and humor for spin and flavor.. it just doesn't land. what may compound it all is that pj's writing doesn't have quite the sharp edges on it as it used to. age brings that on in all of us. pj hasnt quite hit the grumpy ol' man part of his career yet. to take a book like the wealth of nations and do a think-tank review on it is asking a lot of any author with any style or talent. pj gave it a go but honestly, i yawned a lot. not the best pj"	2
this book was something that i read in one day, just to pass the time.  i really didn't care about the characters, and lara seemed just too unreal to be true.  she was too much of scarlet o'hara in her dealings with a real estate world dominated by men.  i only finished it to find out what crisis happened that gave her an empty birthday party, but when i finally came to the end, it wasn't too satisfying. flat, but fast	2

before i read this book, i was a fanatic of the movie bambi. i still am, but it's very different from the book and it seems like 15 minutes after you read the book. i could see everything that was described in the text of the book. it really has an effect on emotions. some things are lighthearted, some things are truly heart breaking, there's even a few laughs. everything is described in much detail. i felt like, at one point, that i was bambi running for the first time in the meadow, drinking in the warm air. i could hear the dogs barking, the hoofbeats, and the gunshots. i highly recommend it to nature lovers and fans of the film. now i just need to read bambi's children. the best book i've ever read!	1
"the reason i don't recommend this book, despite the nice writing and decriptions of the western highlands, is for one dark fact: a number of wild otters died for maxwell's selfish pursuit of having a wild animal as a pet. this is not the story of a man who raises abandoned wild otters cubs in the western highlands and releases them but the story of a man who takes otters from the wild in iraq and africa and tries to raise them in scotland. what this story also tells us is that, if you are of a privillaged class, you can have any wild animal you want as your pet. today this is illegal ""pet"" trading  and it is responsible for pushing certain species to the edge of extinction. i know that at the time this practice was not looked down upon as it is today and certain other nature writers (durrell, heinrich) engage in the same practice but with a more educated populus it should be clear: wild animals are not pets and they should stay wild. why otters don't make good pets"	0

this book is classic dr. seuss...fun, silly, and children don't realize they're learning something.  great book for teaching about maps.  i bought this for my 6 year old prior to going on vacation. we had been looking at maps and talking about what states we'd be driving through on our trip.  he enjoyed listening to the book and because of the way the information is presented (fun and silly rhymes), he has retained what he learned.  he has even referred back to specific bits of information we read from the book (i.e. never eat shredded wheat to remember north, east, south and west.)     the back of the book contains a glossary of terms mentioned in the book.  highly recommended as an additional tool for teaching about maps. fun way to learn about maps	1

"i've just reread ""the cat who smelled a rat."" in it, jim qwilleran is still in fine mettle. this mystery, no. 23 in the ""cat who"" series, is the last one most fans will enjoy. in this book, qwill still remembers small details from previous novels. he's still interested in the mysteries around him, and he does some active snooping around. he's still a bit of the lothario despite himself. and he still has faith in koko's awesome powers.    starting with the next book, the mystery gets solved almost by accident. qwill becomes a parody of himself, and the novels start to get worse and worse. eventually, the books begin to get facts wrong and characters begin to act, well, out of character or just inexplicably drop out of sight. (the latter must be hard to do in a small town 400 miles north of anywhere.) whether lilian jackson braun, now approaching 90, has lost her touch, or whether they're being ghost-written, i leave to you to judge. but the books become just dreadful.    i recommend that readers go out on a high note and stop after no. 23. it's been a good run. go out on a good note"	2
"... and yet i finished it in one sitting! i will warmly recommend this book to my ""foreigner""-friends who are willing to gain a better understanding of the filipino ways as well as to second-generation filipino kids who might just find this book helpful for understanding and perhaps appreciating their parents' quirks. though i will need to caution them about some of the cultural/linguistic info here and there that isn't quite accurate.    unfortunately - even though one might argue that the very existence of this book disproves my impression - i'm mildly disappointed of how the protagonist, throughout the story, appears so eager to ""renounce the country of her birth"". i feel that the book would not have been any less, had the epilogue been left out. besides, was there really a need for those david letterman's top 10s o quasi? the filipino society is avowingly matriarchal, mind you. so, to all of you ""westerners"" out there, better scratch that ""equality""-part. not completely my bowl of rice"	2
i'm reminded of the story of a well-known sf writer who as an experiment tried revising e.e. &quot;doc&quot; smith's galactic epics to remove the obsolete and clunky bits only to find he'd removed all the fun along with  them.  it's only by virtue of not tampering with the original text that  benford avoids commiting the same fault but with premeditation.  of course  &quot;against the fall of night&quot; is obsolete sf.  that doesn't matter.   what matters is its atmosphere, and it is this atmosphere that benford  rejects systematically and irreverently.  clarke might not have objected to  the changes, but authors view their works very differently than the readers  do. benford's work is not a sequel; it's a rebuttal.	2
"this book promised the world, the author and his friends sounded reputable and knowledgable; it was only the cover art that looked dodgy.   we have often been told to not judge books by their covers, but in this instance, the cover illustration gives a good indication of the content: cheap and childish.  the font is large and type set far apart, which makes the small amount of content fill the many pages. there are dozens of spelling and grammatical errors in the book, and a remarkable amount of irrelevant stories. (matt, do you think your readers care that you just bought a new mercedes? we do not. there is nothing in this story for me, unless you are going to teach me how to do the same thing. the story needs to have a point and some benefit to the listener or reader!)  much of the book's ""million dollar tips"" can be found faster and for free on the internet, just by doing a google search on ""marketing techniques"". indeed, much of the book (when it is not self-congratulation) refers to websites where one can find more information. i gather that at least some of the websites may be owned by, or affiliated with, matt and his team.  if this is a sales brochure for another online course, it does not advertise well or read well. look elsewhere for lessons on how to market and sell effectively. look elsewhere"	0
"this book covers a lot of ground, so if it starts with some awfully basic stuff, that's okay. the only real complaint that i have is that the authors are a bit too rah-rah for my taste when discussing marketing, but then, that's probably par for the course; everybody who is into marketing tends to go overboard on the bubbly, fake energy. that, and the fact that they demonstrate an astounding lack of understanding of basic arithmetic when they assert that ""while saving 2% by paying a bill early may not sound like much, doing it over the course of a year will save you 24%"". worthwhile elementary text."	2
i've read some of the braun series cat books and this one wasn't one of my favorites. it was boring with no plot and it did mention very little about the butterfly girl or who she is. the story didn't make any sense at all. i couldn't get into this one. i read it but was disappointed in it. i'm lucky that i only paid $1 for it towards charity. not on of brauns best	0
i would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking better fit in dressmaking.  the seam method of pattern alteration is pretty easy and straightforward.  judith presents alterations for the bodice, skirt, and pants.  with the information in this book, you can alter your pattern for square or sloping shoulders, wide or narrow hips/waist, thin arms, rounded back, and many other necessary alterations.  i did not find the bust alteration to be very helpful to me, however.  i prefer other methods, but i often use the seam method for widening my waist and hips in my own patterns.  additionally, judith offers style suggestions to flatter various figures.  it is an interesting and useful book. this is a great book covering the seam method.	2
"don't waste your time reading this book - this book is awful! this book was supposed to be so good, according to the other reviews, and it's definitely not a good novel. in fact, this is by far the worst novel i have read in my life. i think one of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head - most of this book just seems like random writing and ultimately it has no real purpose for carrying forward the plot line. indeed, it definitely seems like he was just trying to meet a word count for the publisher. the edition of the book i read was slightly over 700 pages, and it could have easily been reduced to 300 without affecting in any way the plot line. thus the reader is left to swallow 400 pages of pointless writing that just seems like ""waffling"" to mention the term used in england to describe writing that leads you no where. not only that, but the 300 pages devoted to actually explaining the plot are not that interesting anyway. the plot line of the novel is incredibly implausible; a prince who is an ""idiot"" but on occasions doesn't seem like such an idiot after all and who suffers from a mysterious illness of ""idiocy"" that could not be labelled as an actual illness by modern medicine. moreover, one of the principal characters in the novel, aglaia yepanchin supposedly is madly in love with the prince while at the same time making fun of him in a very rude way right in front of his nose - am i the only one here who thinks this is just a little implausible? and then just to make matters worse, and as an appetizer after having to swallow 650 pages of horrible writing, near the end of the novel dostoyevski puts in the mouth of the prince two full pages of the most outrageous slander against the catholic religion i have read in my life. supposedly, according to dosteyvski, atheism comes from the catholic religion - certainly dosteyevski doesn't hide his hatred for the catholic faith. even atheists would laugh at such an absurd proposition. dostoyevsky at his very worst"	0
"while most of the one year chemistry texts cover more or less the same principles, the order varies, the illustrations are similar, but they vary most in the way they explain the material.  it is in the vocabulary they use and develop that helps the student develop the intuitions, understanding, and skills the authors are after.  this is a very well written text that is useful for non-chemistry majors as well as science students needing an introductory course in chemistry.    i am reading and working through this text with my 13 year old son.  yes, he is bright and interested in science, but the text is clear enough for both of us to be able to grasp and understand the principles each section of each chapter is presenting to us.  not only does this text focus on teaching the basic principles of chemistry, it also includes historical notes in the margins, and the text focuses on the practical uses of chemistry to illustrate its principles through practical applications.  while other texts also have these features, i believe this text to be quite accessible to even those without a strong previous grounding in science.    each chapter begins with a series of bullet points introducing what is going to be discussed along with a short essay.  i like the marginal notes and illustrations as well as the ""give it some thought"" feature that asks the student a question or two in order to clarify understanding and ensure a grasp of the principles introduced in that section.  like most modern textbooks, there is also a liberal use of color to aid in presentation and guide the eye.  the authors also provide occasional ""strategies in chemistry"" boxes that encourage the student to develop a certain kind of thought process and ways in looking at the principles of chemistry.      at the end of each chapter is a section called summary and key terms that hits the highlights of each section in a paragraph or two with the key terms in boldface.  then there is a section called visualizing concepts that have basic problems with illustrations in order to get the student to work mentally on the material learned.  the section of problems has a series of questions for each section with the red numbered questions having the answers in the back of the book.      there are also a series of handy tables provided as appendices and standard charts on the inside of the front and back covers including the periodic table.  again, many of these features are included in other texts because there has been quite a bit of convergence on what is to be taught in a one year introduction to chemistry course.  the differences are in the way things are said more than what is covered.    i think this is an excellent and very useful text for learning the basics of chemistry and why it matters in our world. an excellent and understandable introduction to chemistry"	1

"this is actually an excellent introduction to short term trading. everything is well explained and pleasantly written. day trading 101. however, it's not really marketed as that, so it gets 2 stars.    if you read this book and much of it is a revelation, you need to spend the next 4-6 months doing research, reading, and paper trading. if you were to start trading based on what's in this book you would lose your shirt.    it's akin to a book on football that explaines the field, how far apart the lines are, where the end zone is, who the players are, what the positions do, what a pass is, the three things that can happen when you pass, etc. it would even have a few basic plays, the ""long pass"", ""student body right"", etc. everything you need to know about football, except how to actually play and win.    basic, well explained information is what this book has. and if you're just getting into trading it's a worthwhile read. it'll give you a foundation that will help you understand more advanced books like secrets of an underground trader or technical analysis of the financial market (murphy).    but even the lack of advanced technical stuff is not really a strike against toni's book. the technical books really are just research books for helping you design your own system. they are practically outdated as soon as they come out and even if they're not, it's a dangerous thing to rely on someone else's system. you need to design a system that you can trade and you're comfortable trading. if you can't do this, no book can help you.    which leads to the main reason i gave the book 2 stars. lack of any real discussion of trading psychology. the book you need to buy if you're going to trade is reminiscences of a stock operator. it's 80 years old and explains the mentality of trading as well as any book out there. the psychology of risk is another good book. understanding what it takes to trade and determining if you have that is critical. as is understanding if you can make split second decisions when it's $40k of your own money on the line.    toni devotes a few pages to it, including a silly 'psychology quiz' which is probably the same quiz they use in the back of cosmo to determine whether you're an agressive lover or a passive one.    she also devotes a page at the end of each chapter to 'self-help' tips. it's true that you can't design a system for yourself if you don't know yourself, so these are helpful. at the end of the day tho, they won't explain what it takes mentally to be a trader. personally, i find yoga to be a good way to clear my head in the morning and get focused. but it's a means to end. not the end itself. such are the self-help tips in the book. if you don't know what you're trying to achieve, they are only so useful.    so if you've read several books on trading you can skip this. there are much more advanced books out there.    if you're new to trading and are looking for a well written book explaining the basics and a bit more, this is worth the money. but it's not a classic or something you'll find yourself referring to as the years go by. good beginner guide, but not much more"	2

grand hotel, the translation of menchen im hotel, is about a group of strangers staying at a posh hotel in berlin. each of them have their troubles and become connected throughout the novel.     baron von geigern is a down-and-out man who steals to maintain his lavish lifestyle. he falls in love with the aging dancer grusinskaya one night when attempting to steal from her. she immediately latches onto him because he is young and she feels rejuvenated by his affection. the best scene in the book is that between the baron and grusinskaya the morning after; it is filled with psychology and understanding of the two characters. kringelein is a pathetic man who comes to the hotel to spend his life savings on the last few days of his life, hoping to finally find happiness. he meets the baron who takes him under his wing to show him a good time. flammchen is a stenographer employed by preysing at the hotel who falls in love with the baron. preysing plots to cheat on his wife with flammchen who he becomes obsessed with, but is more concerned with the possibility that his company could completely deconstruct. dr. otternschlag is a sad man who always checks for mail at the front desk but never has any. he observes the hotel and acts as sort of a narrator at times to the story. each character is made realistic by the author, and the plot twist at the end serves as an appropriate and exciting climax.     i read the book because i loved the film starring john barrymore as the baron, greta garbo as grusinskaya, lionel barrymore as kringelein, joan crawford as flammchen, wallace berry as preysing, and lewis stone as otternschlag. it is a wonderful adaptation and a beautifully photographed film. however, there are some differences, as there always are when books are made into films. the baron is slightly more likable in the book than in the film because more attention is paid to him. one needs to read the book to understand grusinskaya's motivations; since a young star played her in a very exaggerated way, the character seems more insane than justified in her actions. kringelein is somewhat less respectable in the book but just as likable. flammchen looks differently in the film, but is better developed and more realistic in it as well. preysing is just as dull in both. dr. otternschlag is paid much more attention in the book than in the film. overall, the book is more philosophical about the characters and their relationships to each other because it does not rely solely on dialogue like the film. fine piece of literature	2
if you want the opposite of james frey--that is, if you want to read beautiful, true prose that doesn't flinch from the deeper truths, read caldwell. this is a book about west texas, growing up, leaving home, struggling with family, remembering the farm, hating vietnam, going to mexico, reading great books, moving forward. i put a pot of coffee on and read through the night, then passed it on to my dad, who did the same. thanks, ms. caldwell. a strong west wind: a mighty memoir	1
"while i thought that ms. warner's points were accurate, she spends the entire book going over and over the same points until one is simply tired of hearing about the problem with no idea how to escape it. i agree that many of today's famalies are over-scheduled and spending way too much time at daily multiple activities rather than living. this book points out a problem but does nothing to suggest how to combat it.     one quote from the book i found offensive was on pg. 25, ""i had no qualms about eliminating those activities i found needlessly boring or stupid-like the lap-sit story hour at the nearby american library..."" as a children's librarian i guess i took this harder than others would. i agree that many activities could and should be scaled back and or cut, but perhaps ms. warner fails to understand that story hour is an effort to teach parents how to share books at home with kids. of all the things to cut it is my hope people will opt out of soccer for a 3 year old and take a trip to the library once in a while. 1 good thought much over-discussed"	2
"the main character of hospital sketches is nurse tribulation periwinkle. the book is about her experiences as a nurse at a washington d.c. hospital during the civil war. the theme is cheerful despite the wounded men. one man showed his gratitude for the way she helped him stay cheerful by offering ""i've got a pair of earbobs and a handkerchief pin i'm a-goin' to give you""(alcott 69). cheerfulness is shown when a nurse says, ""bless their hearts...""(alcott 75) because she is so proud of the soldiers. the author makes everything more confusing than it has to be. for instance, ""as we quitted them, followed by grateful glances that lighted us to bed""(alcott 75). she uses this sentence to say that people smiled at the nurses as they went to bed. she often switches from one subject to another without making any indication of it, leaving you confused. ""at the beginning of my reign, dumps and dismals prevailed""(alcott 77). she says this while she is telling you about the breakfast she is eating. that has nothing to do with breakfast. she is unclear about what she is referring to. the main conflict doesn't come until the end. she gets sick and needs to decide whether to keep on working there, or go home and try to get better. she decides to go home because her father says, ""come home."" i think this book was poorly written, and i don't recommend it to anyone. hospital sketches"	0

this is the second in the secret texts trilogy and takes off where diplomacy of wolves ends.  focusing on the rebirth of a prophet and the plan of the long dead dragons, a group of destructive magicians, to again  rule the world, the twists are many and the action great.  the sabirs  figure greatly in both sides of the battle, and kait learns more about her  karnee abilities.  again the magical system is wonderfully complex and the  consequences make magic anything but mundane.  i could not put this book  down, and can't wait for the next installment of the trilogy.  lisle has  increased her skills as a writer over the years, adding to her natural  talent as a story teller.  great characters, original settings, a winner. continues where diplomacy of wolves left off.  wonderful.	1

ah yes...tarantino's first script entitled true romance which he sold for 30,000 dollars is a genius effort of great proportion and the writing, you will notice in subsequent films and scripts,is common for him. certain  terms will show up later on in other movies. and as for reservoir dogs,his  second greatest film ever,he used the money from true romance's script to  make this ingenius mob classic complete with terms used in his other films  including one or two from true romance. quentin-sential screenplays	1

i hesitated ordering this book because a previous reviewer reported that he had found the binding to be inferior. perhaps this was true in previous bindings, but the copy i recently obtained looks fine in this regard and should stand up to heavy use for some years to come.    i'm finding this an excellent disctionary in all regards, though as a beginner i have not put it to lots of use. basically i use the new nelson, with this dictionary as a supplement, especially for compounds. and there are times when this alternate system of radical identification is just easier than the traditional system. binding concerns	1
"i saw this book for the very first time, while browsing through a book store in london heathrow airport.   honestly, what caught my eyes is the name of the book.   unlike all other books  i read about hinduism, this book is very simple.  i read the whole book during my flight from london to new york.  this book answered all my questions i had about my culture my culture as well as my  religion.   i also learned so aspects of  christianity also from this book. the book  also helped me to answer all type of questions my christian friends ask me.   now when they ask me, ""why hindus worship many gods?"" i can answer them, ""hindus worship  the one and only god - brahman which express itself in many forms.""  when they ask me, ""why hindus worship idols?"" i can answer them, ""like every one else, including christians, hindus use idols or icons to concentrate on god who has no name or form.""  i can also tell them that hindus believe  that every person   who search  after  truth will attain  salvation [ self-realization]  irrespective of whether he or she is a hindu or christian or moslem.    am i a hindu? is indeed a book for  indians born in the west who are desperately trying to learn about their faith.  in short, am i a hindu? is  a great   book for anyone who wants to know everything about hinduism.    an amazing  book  without any dogma or demagoguery. an excellent book for indians born in usa"	1
i made it to page two of the text (page seven of the book) and got disgusted with her style.      from this page alone: ka-boom. and this man skinner. maniacal psychologist. baby in a box so as to raise her. whatever humanity he touched turned to bone. [?].  this i know to be true.  this much we presume we know. genuine court of law.  boom-boom went the gun.    note there is not one quotation mark here.  this is her writing and the editor's editing.  i don't know if i can go on!  i'm very sorry i bought this book. i got to page two...	0
and simple math answers too. for example, (1/2)(2/3) = ? they say it's 1/6. i'm of the opinion that it's actually 1/3. that's just one of several i've ran across.    still, it's better than nothing, but i think looking at your old college textbooks and doing the ets questions is probably a better route. some of the answers are wrong	2
"i received this book for christmas and was annoyed by the writing style within the first 50 pages.    the story itself isn't bad, but i found the writing styles simplistic and like i said before, annoying.  the four main characters have no chemistry.  they are supposed to be the best of friends but you never feel any emotion out of any of them.    the same phrases are also uttered over and over and over again.  here these people are, on the brink of something magical and amzing that they have found that will turn the world on the edge and all you hear constantly uttered out of one of the character's mouth is, ""i sure wish i knew.""      hey look, i can't believe it, how did those people build gateways to other worlds?  boy, i sure wish i knew.  hey!  look at that amazing and terrifying flying insect, how does it fly with such small wings?  i sure wish i knew.    maybe i expected too much of this book since i don't read sci-fi only.   but as i said, i could hardly finish this book much less read anything else written in this style.  what a shame =. i won't read another book by this author"	2
this book was a new choice from our professor who was teaching our mechanism design class. in my opinion, the three authors who wrote it each took a section and slapped their parts together. totally different writing style as you go throught the book. in addition t is a small book and you constanlty are turning pages to makes references to figures which makes it hard to read with good flw. n addition a lot of the diagrams are unclear and dont necessarily say what they represent. our professor ended up hating the book himself. a good reference maybe but not for the beginner. i would look elsewhere	2
i found this book extremely boring and very hard to read.  the conversations don't flow and the interaction between characters seems abrupt.  in fact, i didn't even finish the book that is how borning it was.  now, i don't normally review every book i read unless i have very strong feelings and this produced a very strong sense of a waste of time!!!  do yourself a favor and get another book.  maybe something by diane mott davidson. i can't believe someone would read this!!	0

"i wanted to throw out a comment to the lengthy review blasting elena and clay's relationship. i loved this book, not only because kelley armstrong doesn't waste time with characters that run around wringing their hands and whining about how 'cursed' they are. too many authors in this genre waste time with this kind of nonsense. the whole ""i'm not human therefore i'm damned"" thing.     if you read kelley's e-novella about clay and elena's first meeting, you see very clearly that elena actually had a great deal in common with clay before she was changed. i think that was what drew him to her. no, his actions later on weren't very noble, but i think when you understand that he doesn't think like a human, then you understand him better.     also, this book does a good job of introducing the three way relationship between clay-elena-jeremy. the fact that the main characters are not alpha wolves, but betas(the followers of the pack) really is a nice touch.    i love this story, it's one of my favorites. i like the fact that kelley armstrong went outside of the box to inject something a little different into her wolves. to many authors are lazy with their subjects. she's the real deal. don't look thru human eyes"	1
"i have taught a couple of summer schools with prek and kindergarten students and we had soooo much fun with many of these songs.  the absolute favorite is the first song ""hello to all the children of the world"", which teaches children to say hello in different languages.  we did half sign language, half movement which made it not only fun for the kids, but also for the parents when we sang this song to them.  the other favorite songs: ""brown girl in the ring"" and ""going over the sea"".  if you are a teacher or even a parent, your kids will love this cd and will learn a little culture in the process. excellent for world-themes in the classroom!"	1
michael seid's extensive experience yields some useful insights and he explains many of the steps involved in franchising, but the book reads too much like advertorial and seid spends way too much time trumpeting his own accomplishments. (wendy's founder dave thomas' contributions to the book are woefully slim and including him as a coauthor seems to serve more as a marketing tool.) franchising for dummies would be a worthwhile addition to your library on the subject, but if you're looking for a single, objective, authoritarian source on the subject, keep looking. there must be better books on franchising	2
breaking the chain was a truely disappointing book for me.  although the sub-title is &quot;the true story&quot; it seemed that the text reflected more innuendo than it did &quot;truth&quot; concerning drug use in the cycling world.  in a time when the cycling world is trying to get back on it's feet after being rocked with gossip about drug use (particularly epo), the book seems to add to, rather than take away from, the culture of rumor.  i finished the book with the feeling that the author wrote it not to inform the world of drug use in professional cycling, but rather as a means of making money (now that he was without employment).  i am sorry that i may have contributed to his retirement fund by purchasing the book. disappointing	0
"i found this book well written and deals with key issues that are importnat in todays world such as immigration, nationalism, democrasy and terrorism.     the book is divided into 4 parts. each of these parts include issues that examine nationalism, immigration, governments and racism. also anti-immigrant sentiments, the ""war on terror,"" muslim and jewish semitism as well as importnat issues of power.     i found a section particularly interesting dedicated to helping people understand where trouble and violence may erupt in volatile areas. due to rifaats personal experience with turbulence and war, he became alerted to several factors which lead him to predict where aggressive nationalism may occur. he formalized a model to help foresee where trouble and violence might erupt.     he states this modle proved useful over the years, as he prevented a multinational corporation from putting its head office in beirut a few years before civil war broke out. he read the signes indication the possibility of violence on a large scale.     the four factors which rifaat formulated to reliably indicate a probable outbreak of violence is the instinctive nature of group formation coupled with fanning the falmes of nationalism, the lack of human inhibition for killing and the power leaders possess.     the book offers an interesting, exciting and sometimes humorous view into world politics, racial profiling, terrorism and above all, lessons in human nature. if you want a witty insight into these issues get this book. well written hot topic."	1
this is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book. this book, in my opinion, is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders. a complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance. take time researching this book before you buy it because it's the worst book i've ever purchased. unreadable	0
i had been familiar with the kenny book &quot;wittgenstein&quot; and &quot;wittgenstein's vienna&quot; but after having read monk's vol 1 on russell knew this would be an excellent read. oddly enough it left me with the question, &quot;are geniuses born or made?&quot; much of what monk did for us with this book was give us a solid feel for the life of the person within which the philosophy could make sense. why did wittgenstein write the way he did? answered. what issues drove him? answered. i would say this book is must reading for a better sense of the man. must reading for a better sense of the man	1
i recently bought this book and found it to be very easy to read, rather than just have lists of grammatical tables like some books i have seen. the author recommends helpful websites throughout the book and makes use of 200 short passages that can be read as you go. all grammar is covered in the beginning chapters, and the following ones are devoted to metre, poetic style, grammar of poetry, how to read old english manuscripts, spelling variants, phonetics, and then an anthology of texts. the glossary is full of translations of every word used in the texts. i think this book is excellent for the beginner who wants to gain a sound overview of the language. an easy read	1
the lexicon is the most comprehensive source of rand writings and ideas.  however, it is not all inclusive: she has spoken about parenting,  child-rearing, and children. one example is a radio interview that she did  discussing romantic literature which led to a discussion on children and  parenting. also, look at &quot;objectivist epistimology&quot; where she  discusses how a child develops cognitively (which would have connections  with raising a child). ommission? not really!	2
save your money and leave this book on the shelf. this guide to summer programs is disorganized and unclear. moreover, most of the information is duplicated in its heftier sibling, peterson's &quot;summer opportunities for kids and teenagers&quot;. a useless book	0
jeff bigger's book is well written; however it offers little to our understanding of the unique ethnic contributions of the german and scotch-irish settlers who dominated the cultural landscape of appalachia.  this is seen in his treatment of twentieth century women.  loretta lynn (a native of eastern kentucky) is briefly discussed on only one page while four pages were written about billie holiday (born in eastern pennsylvania and raised in baltimore) and janis joplin.  dolly parton (an east tennessee, native) earned only one page of text and rosa parks (born in tuskegee alabama) received five pages.  janis joplin was born and raised in port arthur, texas.  it seems biggers is confused about the geographic boundaries of appalachia.  he, like many non-appalachian natives who regard themselves as enlightened scholars of culture, want to see appalachia as anything but white and nearly homogeneous with regard to ethnicity.  rediscovering the south's celtic heritage does a much better job of showing the region's culture as it developed over time. ignores the obvious cultural contributions of the scotch-irish	0
while i was reading american normal, i kept asking myself, why is he writing this book.  someone finally asks the author the same question, and his answer is, &quot;i don't know.&quot;  i have a theory.  osborne started out to write a book showing that as is an imaginary problem coined to put labels on eccentrics.  when halfway through the book his research shows him that it's quite a lot more than that, in fact a real syndrome completely different from just &quot;a little eccentricity&quot;, he is lost.  he no longer knows why he is writing.  he keeps mentioning drugs.  there are no drugs in the treatment of as itself.  he keeps metioning psychiatrists.  it's a neurological disorder, not a psychiatric disorder.  he meets, casually, a few aspies, and suddenly he's an expert.  this book mostly made me angry, as it would anyone who knows someone with as.  he seems often to think the whole this is a joke. after all, he's eccentric, and he doesn't have it... worst book i've read on autism yet.  pit. why are you writing this book?  i don't know	0
may i first applaud dr. schneider in seeing the value of alternative treatments as opposed to traditional medicine.  however dr. schneider as with most md's is not a good source of information on alternative forms of treatment.  md's are lucky in their 1000+ hours of education to get one 1/2 of a class on nutrition and alternative therapies.  therefore their knowledge base is close to nil.  most of the stuff he lists is mainstream knowledge. his research is not complete and most of it requires you to talk to your md first who in turn would very unlikely recommend anything natural. however, because americans have a love affair with their md's they spend 244 billion a year on drugs.  this in turn has made dr. schneider's profession one of the top five leading causes of death in the nation (jama). because of this md's who are seeing a shift away from traditional medical care can capitalize immensely on this shift in care by billing themselves as experts.  i'd recommend someone who has many years of experience in nutrition and alternative therapy.  nutritionists, naturopathic physicians, ayruvedic physicians, doctors of chiropractic and osteopathic physicians are much better sources of info.  think about it. i give him credit for trying	0
this was my first bertrice small book and i have to say i was not impressed.  i did not care for the character at all.  she was spoiled, and self rightous to everyone, including her family.  i also thought the book was extremely boring.  there was to much descrpition on small mundane things and not enough plot and action.  it took me forever to get through this book and i am a very fast reader.  this book made me not want to read any of her other books because i am afraid that they will be just as bad.  i hope this was a one time oops for ms. small because this book was not good at all. boring, boring, boring	0
the &quot;simply&quot; series was my first carley books to read . i love her fast paced stories. they are the kind that grab you and dont let go till long after the end. i loved all three books, but i would have to say that this one is my favorie. it is very sensual and had me turning the pages so fast it took only about two hours for me to read the aweseome story. ill be looking for any other titles by carley and snatch them up as fast as possible. i cant wait for what she has in store for us next. oh wow	1
i'm amazed at the positive reviews this book has received. if found it severely lacking for a number of reasons: first, it has very few maps, the ones it does have are terrible, and there is no coordination between descriptions of things and their location on the maps. second, it lacks the kind of detail that you'll find in some other books. finally, the section dealing with accommodations is almost completely useless. overall, i was extremely disappointed with this book.    if you want really good london tavel guides, the rough gude to london and the eyewitness london guide are far, far better. not nearly as good as other london travel books	2
i have always loved paul gallico as a writer, and this short story is one of my favorites of his work. it is a beautiful story that children may like, but adults will love. the story is about a lonely artist, philip rhyader, who retreats from society due to a hunchback and deformed hand. he lives in a lighthouse where he creates his works of art and tends to injured animals.    one day a young girl named frith brings him a snow goose that has been injured. (i loved the book so much that i named my oldest daughter fritha.) although she is at first scared of rhyader, a friendship develops between them as they tend the goose. after the goose is healed, it flies away but returns every year to stay with rhyader for the season. the girl, frith, returns each year when the snow goose returns. rhyader falls in love with her but she does not realize it.    the book ends with the battle of dunkirk when the british troops are trapped on the beach. rhyader, who was unable to fight in the war because of his deformities, takes his small sailboat and crosses the channel several times, delivering the british soldiers to safety. on each trip he is accompanied by the beautiful snow goose.    i'll give you fair warning, the ending of the book is one of the saddest you will ever read. however, the message of love and friendship and hope conveyed in the book will make you want to return and read it over and over again. the most beautiful story ever	1
"living in a milieu far removed from his intoxicating days as a rising painter gaining increasing esteem for his flattering portraits, henry macalpine has isolated himself in a form of penance...    perhaps the penance is for the things he did, for his past selfishnessnes, his past surrender to the ""establishment"", the easy painting that would please and sell swiftly rather than the more difficult portraitures that strip down, as he puts it, to the skull and even to the soul.    but my sense is that his penance is not really for these things.    it is for what he will do...    iain pears is a writer of distinction. more than that, although he writes literature that i believe will be enjoyed by readers of wit centuries from now, pears is also a writer who can tell a rattling good story. his turn of phrase - delicious! i grew to know this henry macalpine as he unburdens himself to his subject, so that macalpine was not just painting a portrait of the self-satisfied old friend, the ""great"" critic william naysmith, but he is also painting a portrait of himself.    we see it all - his attitude to sexuality, religion, penance, art, men, women, crime, superficiality, everything. we see how he has altered and developed, and how he has remained what he is, for in the flowing change and in the constancy both... that is where the truth and validity of a human being lies. we change. we do not change. that is our lot. perhaps in this sense, at the mercy of events, we are true to macalpine's vision of humanity - ludicrous in the face of the great forces such as a storm. but macalpine in all his imperfect self is also revealed by his monologue... and we know we do not take his view as a point of absolute truth (a lovely trick, that. pears did the same thing in ""instance of the fingerpost"", leaving an unsettling notion that the last narrator was the ""real"" truth, but careful reading reveals that it is all just... points of view, self-deceptions, however true the narrator attempts to be). perhaps, then, we are not so ludicrous, and perhaps we transcend the forces of nature.    iain pears's palette-rich writing shows such a balance of line and colour in the careful choice of words, phrases, flow of written thoughts. i can almost smell the texture - it is like ""reading"" a painting. the book glows with colour, the subtle highlights of the artist's brush.    some reviewers have not taken to the monologue style used in this book - i found it extremely effective, and also such a delicious irony in that the critic, wordy and pompous as he clearly was, has absolutely no say here. he is drawn to macalpine's retreat in what seems at first his own choice, but right from the start, i sensed that this was not exactly the case.    iain pears leads the reader through an extraordinary thread of narrative that is remembrance through the eyes of one man. we learn of macalpine's fascination with the image of death, the futility of man in the grip of forces greater than he is, an image of decaying flesh washed up on the shore. we learn also (but suspect it early on) what macalpine considers the real crime that would impel a certain act of murder.    that the denouement is inevitable and foreseen by the reader does not diminish the fascination of this wonderfully dark novel. pears could have written a different book, a book in which the reader is ""fooled"" ? la typical thriller plots. but this book is not a thriller. it is a portrait that creates knowledge, and paints ever more deeply to find motivations and reasons and shadings and colourings, not merely the bare facts. consider this: we know within quite a few pages what is to come. but like garc?a marquez's extraordinary ""chronicle of a death foretold"", it's not what... it's why, how... give us the details; it's the details we want.    i found this work very satisfying. i did not find the monologue style tedious at all, and as soon as i realised pears wanted us to suspect what was coming, i read not to find out the end, but to ""read"" the brush-strokes.    for those who will approach it in this way, i think that there is a gripping and fascinating reading experience waiting for you.    for those who want a twist in the tail with an unexpected ending, no... this miniature portrait of a book is probably not for you.    read the book as a revelation of the skull and soul of two men, and perhaps you too will love this book as much as i did. inexorable, and thereby lies its dark persuasion"	1
"reviewed by debra gaynor for reader views (10/06)    from the moment i saw the cover of this book i knew that i would find pain within.  the pain of a young man facing the abusive life he's survived.  ""emmy, the events we lived through taught me to be sure of nothing about other people.  they taught me to expect danger around every corner.  they taught me to understand that there are people in this world who mean you harm.  and sometimes they're people who say they love you.""    chillingly matt recounts the night he sneaked into the kitchen and took an oreo.  his mother, nikki, held a knife to his throat and cut him, to teach him to never again steal. this is just one incident in the nightmare he calls childhood.     matt's father was gone but matt couldn't blame him, after all he too was terrified of nikki.   for a while murdoch seemed to offer some protect from their mother, but, he too found himself unable to cope with the destructive behavior of nikki.  he cared but was it enough?  matt knew it was up to him.  he knew he had to find a way to get his two sisters and himself away from, their mother, nikki, before she destroyed them all.  matt turned to his father ben for help, but ben was too afraid of his former wife to rescue his own children.    this is the story of a brother's attempt to protect his younger sister from their abusive mother. the story is told in the format of letters from matt to his dear sister, emmy, trying to explain and warn her about life with their abusive mother.  ""as i sit here writing, part of me hopes that you go along happily your whole life and never need or want to know the details.""    this book is painful to read.  but it should be read.  there are many children facing the same situation and we, as society, must stop turning our backs on our precious children.  this book is well written.  the type is large enough for tired eyes to easily read it.  the characters are so real that you cry for them.  i found myself wanting to snatch them from their mother's insane antics and give them safety.  i highly recommend ""rules of survival"" for older youth and adults. must read"	1

a fun introduction to foods that we do not usually think of as comestible. no recipes for newt eyes though, but there are recipes for mice, rats, grasshoppers and pretty much anything else that can creep, crawl or walk. people in other parts of the world make do and enjoy many items that may be very tasty which we would abhor the thought of even eating, even when faced with starvation. french fries and hamburgers aren't everything. surprise - people eat things other than than french fries!	1
watching fred over the years has brought me alot of respect for the game.  this book brings me more respect for him as a person.  we all wonder what it takes to be a superstar, this book details that very thing.  i am proud  to see a writer who can step inside and describe a person like kathlene  bissle did.  fred touches so many people in our precious game of golf.  we  fred thank you and your author for allowing us to step inside of your life  an explore. well documented	1
i remember reading this book as a child and loving it. now 21 and in my 3rd year of college, i come back to the memeories of this book and the stories. still vivid in my mind is the picture of little bear going outside in the cold weather only to return home asking his mother for something warm to wear and in the end relazing he had his own fur coat all along, and then him taking off to the moom.     i'm studying to become a teacher and making a book list for one of my classes and this is sure to be on there. from book to memories	1
"this book is exactly that. i know mr. morehouse and one of the people he writes about in this book... my father, mel riley. all i can say is, you should read paul smith's accounts if you want the truth pertaining to the stargate and rv stories. there is also a documentary, if you can find it, made be discovery bbc called ""the real x-files"" featuring a true and honest view of rv and it's history with the military and all those involved. giving this book much more than 1 star is really admitting lack of intelligence. pure egotistical, twisted accounts of the truth."	0

it appears the the release of previously secret information from world war ii will never end. in this book, the authors have examined the files of the british air intelligence (ai) for every scrap of information they could find on every airplane that the germans had.     then they organized this information so that each airplane has a chronological report of what the british learned, when, and from what source. the main sources are photo recon (pr), prisoner interrogation, and examination of crashed planes.     from a standpoint of studying the planes themselves, there are only a few tidbits of new data (and some of the things that the brits learned were wrong and didn't show up until later). from the view of trying to see what the british were learning and how they learned it it is a fascinating piece of work.     it gives an insight into how intelligence is gathered. it makes it much easier to understand about how big intelligence lapses (pearl harbour, 9/11) can happen.     a specialized book, but very interesting. a view into how intelligence works	1

whether or not astrology can help to predict events, this book gives many examples of how astrology has been used by people throughout a very long history.  although mention is made of a time when common folk, such as those attending the theater, understood astrological portents as a part of everyday life, the book emphasizes how famous and highly-intelligent people made use of astrology for worldwide matters, as well as for practical, personal application such as the time of death (even though some, given the knowledge, tried and failed to change the event).  choosing to elevate the traditional approach over the modern, psychological method is debatable, but the traditional progression in the book from hitler to bush is quite chilling.  well worth the read. chilling	1
there are numerous factual errors that have been refuted in numerous places and unfortunately the author takes potshots and makes false accusations and individuals who are dead and unable to refute his charges.  if you want to read this fine, just remember that even though it's in print doesn't make it true or accurate. fiction should be called fiction	0

simply disastrous work by pohl. after throroughly enjoying the original gateway, i was looking forward to this sequel. my hopes were utterly shattered. in summary, here is why this book was totally unreadable.  1. the main characters, stan and estrella, are totally unbelievable. their dialogue is only slightly above kindergarten level. they are never given any motivation for their actions.  2. pohl fills the pages with useless details, including information about plantlife, and cooking, as well as vomitting and bowel movements. i gave up on the book completely when he decided to indulge in an entire page about one man going to the toilet. maybe he was trying to be funny. it didn't work.  3. total lack of plot development. the book is basically a loosely connected series of random events, stuffed with filler. mid-way through the book pohl begins to introduce entirely new characters in an attempt to generate some kind of plot momemntum. i have never read a more unfocussed science fiction novel. it comes off as really poorly done space-opera.  4. characters are completely flat. stan and estrella are both sickeningly dumb. every other character is the exact same cardboard cutout. aliens act just like humans except they talk funny. it is very cheesy and lacks any attempt at originality.   5. book has an insane number of sex scenes, and they are all badly written. i mean literally, you cannt go more than 15 pages without a sex scene. so juvenile.    i would go on, but i believe my point is made. this book has not a single redeeming feature. if you enjoyed gateway, do not ruin your memory of it by reading this sequel. terrible	0
"alan f. segal's book ""life after death"" is my first read of his work, and certainly the most massive book i have read in some time. considering the sheer scope of the topic segal has attempted to cover, the size of the book should come as no surprise. however, the physical weight is where the ""weightiness"" ends.    now, before you freak out about over 700 pages of text on life after death, it should be emphasised that segal writes in a very accessible and easy going manner. a few of the words he uses require a dictionary, (at least, i needed one), but the incidence of this was not a burden. segal keeps you moving and presents a great level of quotation from ancient sources to highlight his points. his manner and style of presentation and discussion are absolutely fantastic.     segal presents the beliefs of different cultures from a more social viewpoint than anything, and deals with how these beliefs can illustrate what the people thought of about themselves and the world about them. what you end up with is a very interesting discussion not just on life after death, but also some of the political, cultural and social concerns that went into them. this makes for a very well-rounded discussion.    segal takes you through various cultures and civilisations, and throughout he inter-connects various ideas between them to show how they illustrate each other by contrast or simularity. these cultures include chapters on ancient egypt, mesopotamia and canaan, israelite, (broken into various chapters), and much more, including detailed chapters on christian views and their development through the centuries.    this book is really a great overview of the topic, and it is relatively easy to find from segal's referencing further material for more specific reading. segal has done exceptionally well to squeeze such a vast topic into about 750 well-written and dynamic pages.    this book gets a big ""thumbs-up"" from me. i will certainly be reading more of segal's work in the future. a weighty tome"	1
this is a thoughtful and well researched book. it answers some of the questions which bother most indians are we aryans or dravidians, how did the indus valley civilization dissappear . the manner in which they explain  the myths like the one about the vijayanagar empire tells us about the  research put in by the authors. i would recommend this book to novices as  well as connosieurs of indian histor. a concise and beatiful rendition about the history of india	2
"robert mann, a former congressional aide, fails to disappoint in his comprehensive political history of the nation's longest war.  mann focuses on the politics and policy that led to the worst military defeat in american history.      for the most part, ""a grand delusion"" turns its gaze away from the action on the ground in indochina, examining instead the decisions that policymakers in washington faced during the war, the political pressures brought to bear on them, and the choices that they made over the course of twenty-five years.  mann finds the roots of american involvement in the bitter political debates that erupted following the ""loss"" of china and north korea's invasion of its southern neighbor, as president truman suffered mortal political damage from his apparent inability to stem the communist tide in asia.  from those disasters, american policymakers took the first of several dangerous delusions: no politician could survive if he allowed an asian country to fall to a communist government.      as the situation in south vietnam deteriorated in the face of a virulent and effective communist insurgency, us government officials stirred more ""delusions"" into the policymaking mix: after the debacle at munich in 1938, the west must always use force against its enemies, regardless of the nature of the threat or the national interests implicated; the vietcong guerillas were communists first and nationalists second, with their foremost goal the spread of global communism and not national independence from the french; the unification of vietnam under communist leadership would threaten other american allies in southeast asia; america's national security depended on the success of the south vietnamese government; and south vietnam was ultimately capable of mustering the will, the political reforms, and military capability to defend itself, provided that the us stood by it until it could do so.  each of these assumptions, according to mann, was disastrously wrong.  mann charts how these assumptions, like the progression of a fatal illness, infected every step of the policymaking process, leading five presidents to escalate america's involvement.      mann guides the reader through the internal debates that led policymakers down this dangerous path, showing how officials from both parties clung to these false assumptions and how these delusions informed their decisions.  mann pays special attention to the relationship between the white house and the senate, the branch of congress that the founders expected to have more of a role in foreign affairs because of its longer terms and power over appointments and treaties.  perhaps the most tragic figure in this book is senator mike mansfield, the majority leader through much of the war, who suppressed his doubts about the war out of political loyalty to the president and the sense that the senate must not undermine the commander in chief in a time of war.  indeed, much of the book is a story of how congress threw aside its constitutional responsibilities to declare war and provide oversight to the executive's foreign policy, and how it slowly reclaimed those powers.    the book has a few defects.  the book contains far too many spelling and grammatical errors.  also, at times, the narrative bogs down in bureaucratic minutiae, leaving some passages as interesting as a typical inter-office memo.  still, the book is a noteworthy addition to the literature of the vietnam war by reminding us how it came about and why.  if anything, it has only become more relevant since it was first published: readers will find haunting parallels, for instance, between vietnamization and ""as iraqis stand up, we will stand down."". thorough account of the politics and policy behind the war"	1
"here it is now, 2006, and we have moved back into the 50's in so many ways. look at so many 20 somethings like paris hilton and the ways she disgraces herself without any inkling that she is doing it.  look at all the role models we see in films and tv, where women are either bitches, promiscuous, or over-siliconed airheads. thank god howard stern is no longer on tv.  we've come a complete 180 degrees, and women get no respect.  i don't think hilary clinton and condoleeza are any help. the women we see in public have no conception of how their public imcompetence, stupidity and general buying into the concept of woman as sex object for men has hurt us.   now men feel free to dispose of their wives by killing them. the number one cause of death of pregnant women is by homicide. let a woman with a history of being abused by her boyfriend go missing, and the cops don't bother to look for her.  it's ok to the authorities if young women get killed. who cares except the grieving family? it's common in high schools for girls to be physically abused by their boyfriends, and the girls still love and protect them.  women are to be used, abused, and disposed of.  our society is run by men, for men, and it has not changed one bit in the past one hundred years. we can't even decide for ourselves anyomore if we want an abortion.  daddy government says no. all the right wing ""christians"" running the country really just want to keep women in the dark ages before abortion, barefoot and pregnant and out of the work force. and women don't even get it!  i am currently packing to move to scandanavia where women are respected and treated as equals. birth control, abortions and prostitution are legal and accepted. unlike america, in a few countries women at least own their own bodies. this lays out all the ways we women keep getting beaten down..."	1
"this book should have been called ""what can you buy if you are thinking about playing with scanner"", and it is good at that. it does not tell you much about scanning, it is more about buying equipment, and possibly software related to scanning. just think about it: there is a chapter ""where to buy"", and a chapter ""buying on ebay"". there is no chapter ""do this if you miss shadow detail"", though. this book is aimed at a high school student who is doing his/her first steps with a film camera and wants to get those pictures into the computer (is there such a person these days?) the book even mentions cross processing. no, it does not say what should you do if you need to scan a cross-processed film. it just says that you can process your film in the wrong developer and it will affect the image on the film.   i was greatly impressed by the chapter on sending off your slides for scanning. well you definetly need a book to tell you that you can do that, and it greatly improves your scanning skills  if i had a chance to look at the book at the local store i would not ever buy it. now it goes back to amazon. mastering scanner stuff buying"	2
so, what happens is, you're playin' with a bunch of nashville dudes, see? they're cuttin' this song, and the big-shot says, &quot;progression is 1, 4, 5 ... the chorus goes: 4, 5, 6minor - three times; fourth time, it goes  4, 5, 1.&quot; what do you do? you go, &quot;what key is it in?&quot;  'course, you should be able to figure that out by a quick listen, and a tap  or two on your guitar ... but even if you don't, someone's bound to think  you're just lazy, and blurt out, &quot;it's in g, man!&quot; so, okay ...  big deal. you can count! you know the song goes g, c, d ... exept in the  chorus, which goes c, d, em - three times, and then c, d, g the fourth  time. the cool thing about it, is when the vocalist arrives and he/she  can't sing in the key of g! ... it has to be in the key of d! nothing  changes. the progression is still 1, 4, 5, etc. -- only now you're starting  from d as #1 and counting. so, now we're gonna play d, g, a ... and the  chorus goes g, a, bm - three times; fourth time is g, a, d. pretty simple,  huh? everybody can do their private math, quietly, and, in ten minutes when  the tape starts to roll, everybody sounds like they knew what was up all  the time. the vocalist is very impressed! and, most of all, the guy cutting  the checks is smiling. an excellent resource for an excellent tool!	1
we are in the logistics business and i reviewed this book as a potential teaching tool for management. the book is unfortunatley of little to no value. most concerning is that the mathematics for inventory management, a critical factor in understanding logistics, are simply wrong. even a quick look by anyone familiar with inventory management would find this concerning. would not recommend	0

"the third in ms. cameron's trilogy continues her writing legacy. i'll get my bias right out front -- i purchased dozens of ""the artist's way"" more than a decade ago, and continue to gift friends with ""the vein of gold"" and ""walking in the world."" hers are about the only books i buy in hardback because i know i'll return to them again and again. it's not just the guidance that makes her books so compelling. her phrasing, syntax, ability to draw the reader into her environment and circumstances, makes me keep coming back for more. she is a great story teller, as well as generous with her insights.    that said, her third volume is a bit like watching a train wreck. especially chapter 5, as we enter the abyss with her, i began to feel some cracks in the foundation of daily pages and artist's dates. it appears that ms. cameron is struggling with her own advice -- ""keep the drama on the page."" and some of us may feel our own resolve begin to crumble. but as the book progresses, the theme of perseverance certainly proves its value.     those of us who feel we know ms. cameron recognize instantly why she would be walking on mental eggshells. not only is she not going back to taos this summer, but she also has chosen to close out her artist's series with this third book. readers will miss both, and in that knowledge share a small bit of the grief that ms. cameron must be experiencing. julian cameron perseveres"	2

"this book would be more aptly titled, ""equiptment you could and should buy for photographing interiors"".  it's designed for amateurs who don't know anything about photography and want to be walked through the process of buying the right equiptment and then left in the dark as to how to properly use it.  i know something about photography, and was looking for a book that would talk about photographing interiors and some exteriors.  i was interested in uses of perspective, lighting to add drama, that sort of thing.  the writer, once explaining the theory behind photographic principles, talks, not about how he was able to take successful pictures, but just that he did.  he mentions the equipment he used and tells where he set it up, but for all his superflous text, leaves the reader with only the knowledge of how to re-create his shot in the same location under the same conditions.  it began as an interesting read, as he explained about what the pros use.  then he explained what the beginner could buy, but why it's not really as good.  he showed a few examples of how lighting effects a scene and alters color, but in general, his ""shooting by beginners on a tight budget"" should be ""shooting in these locations by beginners with several grand to spend on equiptment"".  i was hoping for a book that talked about the uses of lighting, the uses of color, actually shooting something besides huge, open, commercial structures.  this is my first return to amazon. not what it says it is"	2
there are 149 5 star reviews and 92 one star reviews.  this is more representative than an analysis based only on the last 20 reviews. but what is more notable than that is the fact that  the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them.    lone nut theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false.    posner totally disregards the parkland hospital doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head. he would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot. that somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts.    to expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting. 149 vs 92	0
"this book was arcane and verbose which made it very difficult and unenlightening.  the author digresses often and seems to add-in superfluous commentary on unrelated subjects.   his references often point to ""current events"" which have long since lost relevance and the entire text has a dated, maze-like feeling.    if you're looking for an account of the life of st. francis of assisi, i would not recommend this book.  if you are familiar with the life of st. francis and are looking for a commentary on the events of his life you may find this work helpful due to its supposed eminence among works about the saint. rambling and overbearing"	2

a book on style that starts from the inside--yes, please! it's great to feel good in your clothes, but that's frosting on the cake. to feel beautiful inside and out takes so much more than a great scarf or well-cut jacket (fabulous as those are!), and this book is one of the very few that truly recognizes that. it's a shame that some people spend a huge amount of time and money on trying to perfect their outer image without realizing that there are people who feel (and are!) beautiful in thrift-store clothes and there are people wearing clothes from vogue and w who feel flawed and ugly. this book goes much deeper than many books on style, and for that reason it's a fantastic addition to the books that focus only on fashion tips. beauty is an attitude	1
the title of the book certainly was a great inducement to buy the book.  thinking that it would be an informed commentary on key elements of bush's character, i purchased this book and eagerly awaited its arrival.      starting off well, the author lays out what he purports to be the architecture of a meaningful and detailed analysis.  then, sadly it degenerates into a self serving diatribe filled with epithets and derogatory terms.      whether or not you support the president, any credible review of his actions from a psychiatry perspective should at least appear unbiased.  not the case here.  mr. frank quickly descends into child like name calling and remarks that should never come from a professional.  he cites theories from others that indicate it is impossible to accurately apply a diagnosis without lengthy study, then in the next few paragraphs violates that premise by applying the very diagnosis he earlier claimed was impossible.    finally, (and i have learned my lesson here) the final words of the book are a call for bush's impeachment.  what that has to do with an unbiased psychological analysis i have no idea.  i now will read the final paragraph from any book mr. frank writes to understand his motivation before sharng my hard earned money with him.    unless you are a closed minded rabid bush hater, this book will not appeal to you.  if you are of such ilk, just rewards are yours for the reading. blatant puppetry of the anti-bush movement	0

"for me, there are two key assertions in robert adams' ""beauty in photography"".  first, that we ""live in discouraging hours of society's apparent decay"" (p. 88).  second, that the purpose of art is to ""help us meet our worst fear, the suspicion that life may be chaos and that therefore our suffering is without meaning"" (p. 25).    from these two assertions adams develops his interpretation of photography: photography detects, extracts and emphasizes the beauty around us, and by doing so it points toward something deeper in the world, an organizing power, a coherence supporting the world and our lifes.  to adams, photography is a spiritual exercise, making bearable an otherwise decaying sourrounding.    art not concerned with depicting the world beautifully is, to adams, mere ""decoration"".  thus, adams tells us little interesting about most modern art, and his approach does not generalize, for instance, to music.  that beauty can exist as such, that it can tell us something about ourselves even without refering to things in the world: this does not seem to be adams experience.      in these very conservative views i disagree with adams.  still, i recommend his essays to anyone who wants to understand why some photography is moving us while other is not.  even if adams is not telling the whole story -probably nobody will- he is an excellent writer who talks about art in a clear and understandable way.    the only disappointment with the book was the poor reproduction quality of the images depicted.  as a publisher specializing in photography books aperture could do better. recommended"	2
judith butler's study of antigone, over the course of these 3 lectures, yields important and timely insights about how we might understand kinship and love in today's society. her analysis of hegel, levi-strauss, and lacan is impressively rigorous. a must read for anyone interested in liguistics, structuralism, feminism and contemporary questions about political belonging. very intelligent, ground-breaking book!!!	1
this book is about dolphins. a baby doilphin is born. the book tells how the mother dolphin has a baby. first the baby dolphin's tail comes out. then his head comes out too. then it tells how a baby dolphin is protected by its family. my favorite part was when the baby dolphin was born. i think other kids will like this book because they will learn about dolphins. dolphins	1

peter falk's book was nothing but a few stories.  he only talks about a few columbo episodes, he is so brief and uninteresting. also , he talks about his buddies too much. who cares about john cassavetes!  he talks like he's some filmmaking genius.   if you want to read about peter falk and his life as an actor, it's sadly left out. he doesn't even talk about how he met his wives.  sadly, a very dissappointing book.   not recommended!. disappointing	0
i cannot claim to know much about philip k. dick as this is, thus far, the only one of his novels i have read.  but based on a reading of the game-players of titan, it will not be the last.  the premise of the inhabitants of earth playing the game, bluff, for spouses and land is wonderful and the story only grows weirder and more original with each passing chapter.  the only small quibble is the ending is somewhat anti-climatic after the strongly built, witty, creatively heightened build up but this book is about the journey and one could have no better guide than the author for this unique trip. wonderful premise handled with great skill	2
based on the previous 5-star rave reviews written here, i decided to give this book a try, especially since it's two books for the price of one.  but when i opened up the book, i discovered that you don't even get mackay's complete book; you get just the chapters relevant to finance/investing.  because i was reading the book primarily for insight into trading/investing i thought i would make do.  however there was very little of that to be found, and when it was found, it was typically written in verbose, archaic english, sandwiched between many pages of irrelevant historical minutea such as how exactly transactions were conducted in the 1700's.  there are a couple good gems, but nothing which has not been repeated in more modern books in much simpler language.  e.g. the money game by adam smith or market wizards, or mindtraps by barach or any of tony oz's books.  there are sooo many good trading books out there to read that reading this was a complete waste of time. overated	0
i saw the author during a book signing on television.  i saw a young, intelligent, articulate lady who had some very interesting ideas about american culture.  i picked up the book to learn more about her and her ideas.  unfortunately, though there is a lot of meat in this book, simply put, i was bored...bored...bored.  this is not a subject i take lightly and believe me, i wanted to like this book because i like the author.  i have to agree with a lot of the reviewers here.  there is a lot of data and no real point.  a lousy effort and there are few people more disappointed than me. boring	2

this early nabokov novel is not of the mindbending genius of later works like pale fire and lolita, but it is still better than even the best work by many other writers.     nabokov is a brilliant stylist and imagines the world of his protagonist brillantly. the phrasing is sparse and compelling, but as the main character's mind starts to disintegrate, so does the book. the last third is a bit of a disppotment. a disappointment only because its a nabokov novel, and i've come to expect such great things for him. its worth the time, especially if you have an interest in chess, but i'd read his later works first. you can't go wrong with nabokov and chess	1
"this book is a watered down version of the e-myth revisited, which is a good book. the e-myth contactor - is a summary of m. gerber's program with ""contractor stories."" there is no true insight into the contactor industry. my guess is this is the 1st of many books focusing on specific industries. my advice is to skip this book, just purchase gerber's e-myth revisited & make the connections yourself. weak summary of the e-myth revisited."	2

you can read some of the other reviews to get an idea of some of the specific errors...  the book is loaded with them from wrong moves to other typos...  how can this book help anyone if half the battle is trying to figure out whats going on...  he has quotes from people in years that they already were dead...  games with wrong year and people listed...  sad that they still publish books from this author...  i do not understand why they let books out with so many errors...  when i buy a chess book i expect it to have almost no errors...  this book has more errors than actual things that help players...  if you give this to someone and tell them to find all the errors...  they woudl probably have grandkids and still not find them all...  i dunno what he means by golden nuggets...  i think more work went into thinking of name of book than content...  books like this give chess books a bad name to say very least...  if you want a book on chess strategy try watson's advances since nimzo...  even the mammoth book of chess will help you more than this item...  perhaps even consider silman's strategy grandmaster techniques from a to z book.  hopefully one of those books might help you in your game and give you value for your dollar.. encyclopedia of spelling errors...	0
it's summer, and parker county, texas, is gearing up for the annual peach festival.  that includes retired teacher phyllis and her friend and boarder carolyn.  both women always enter the cooking contest.  carolyn usually wins, and phyllis is determined to beat her this year.    while the two women are out picking peaches, the farm's owner dies.  his death could be ruled an accident, but it might also be murder.  phyllis's son, an officer with the sheriff's department, investigates.  unfortunately, he can't find any conclusive evidence one way or the other.    the day of the peach festival brings another death.  head judge donnie boatwright keels over just after trying phyllis's spicy peach cobbler.  this is a clear case of murder, however.  the man was poisoned.  when phyllis is quickly cleared of suspicion, the police turn their attention to carolyn.  phyllis knows her friend couldn't have done it.  but can she prove it?    the book showed promise at the beginning.  the first death took place in the first chapter.  but then it quickly went downhill.  once donnie dies, the book focuses all the attention there.  still, very little seems to happen.  the characters, carolyn especially, aren't really that likeable.  and the writing style is fairly poor, with dangling modifiers and awkward sentences throughout the book.  even the three recipes in the back of the book could have used a bit more detail.    the book sounded promising, so i'm very sorry i can't recommend it.  i won't be visiting phyllis again. this debut is the pits	0
"the book ""a sense of duty: my father, my american journey"" is really an american story about coming of age and about father son relationships but with a huge twist of circumstances. we are dealing with a family torn apart by the loss of the vietnam war and their subsequent separation. author quang x. pham is shipped to the usa after the fall of saigon with his siblings and mother. his father who is a member of the south vietnamese air force stays behind doing his duty to the very end. thus begins 12 years of imprisonment in the so called ""re-education camps"" while his family adjusts to a new life in america.     the author deals with cultural and language issues and some degree of racism and bigoted treatment. however, the deeper issue for him is not having his father there for him. there is also his lack, at that young age, to fully realize the significance of what his father had done with his life and how well he had served his old country. the book is an eye opener for those of us who have wondered what it was like for these new comers to our shores.      when his father does come to the usa after being released from the ""camps"" he found it tough going. his marriage fell a part and he found that all those lost years with his children, who had grown up without him, haave created a huge gap between them. his children do not really know or understanding who is or even who he was.     the book follows the growing appreciation and understandings that quang eventually gains for his dad. as he learns more about his father's past and sees his personal courage and sense of duty and what drove him to become the man he was.  when the author himself wears the uniform of marine aviator and fights in the gulf war, he begins to gain more insights on the sacrifices that his dad had made for his own country of south vietnam. we take this spiritual and emotional journey with the author as he gradually begins to sense what factors and motives drove his father on his own personal journey.    the book also details and addresses some old history from that time period and that war. most americans have either forgotten or never knew about our national attitudes and polices with regard to the war and lack of regard for our allies the south vietnamese. it may make for some interesting but uncomfortable reading.     it is a well-written and poignant story that embraces two very different wars. his story unites two different generations into an emotional bridge between father and son. it is touching and deeply moving. the author does a great job of making the reader feel a part of the experience. this book receives the military writer's society of america's highest book rating of five stars!     this book also receives my personal endorsement. more than just a coming of age story for a vietnamese refugee.

"the photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition's cover. however you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of the doorbell rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances. the mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen.     with just twenty pages my seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes. the favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story. the doorbell rang begins with a mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son sam and daughter victoria. "" i've made some cookies for tea, said ma"". the children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to grandma's.    by flipping through the pages of the doorbell rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger, but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there, but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats. the cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention. more kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie. it is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth. the serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer. meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail.     the final arrival for this story is grandma, with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. all the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table. not very sanitary as far as i am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table. the dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home.      the portrayal of the mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me. the kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them.     at least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the mother finally sat down. for a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read i highly doubt there would be interest. there is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child's grandma's cookies. there are roughly two to four sentences on each page. the good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this. ding dong - the doorbell rang"	2
i am really impressed with the good ratings this book has gotten so far. i hate it.    the authors incapability to explain the multinational context in simple terms, his approach to pack every little, tiny detail that somehow might correlate to the overall subject into each chapter, and his inability to use formulas and graphs in an understandable way, makes me wonder if the author actually knows what he is talking about. i find this financial book the worst i had to deal with so far. as an honor student with a finance major i feel like shapiro is trying to hard to create a book that covers all. his examples and illustrations are somewhat interesting since they provide some information on how things work in the real world, but they lack something really important that i personally find essential for demonstration purposes: clarity and comprehensiveness.   additionally, i find his approach to verbally describe his calculations in huge paragraphs disturbing. as disturbing is his way to create his own symbols and acronyms and not using those other financial books use. when studying you therefore need so much time in figuring out, what his symbols actually mean, that you would rather read another book.   i personally doubt that shapiro has actually understood the subject himself. he is using the trick i always use when i do not want my professors to notice my lack of understanding: verbosity. quantity is not always good.     i would definitely simplify the book and use clearer formulas, a more mathematical approach, better graphs, more information on how these formulas could be derived, less words, fewer sub-chapters,  more interesting case studies at the end of the chapters, more problems for self-evaluation at the end of the chapters, clearer examples and illustrations....    there is so much room to improve that it might be better to rewrite the whole book using a better author. verbosity should be verboten	0
out of the despair of a young woman needing guidance and   affirmation for her existence, my soul to his spirit is born.  melda beaty longed for the type of love that tells a young   girl she has worth, beauty and unlimited potential. for a   male love that is disconnected from possession, obsession or   penetration; love that only a father can give. never knowing   that magnitude of love, she harbored ill feelings for her   father. traumatized since she was a little girl, her   nightmares ended only after she became a woman with a   legitimate voice, and truly forgave her father.    since her atonement, ms. beaty has been blessed to meet and   share stories with other black women with similar histories   of overwhelming father-daughter relationships. relationships   that more often than not, define how we relate to the men in   our lives. my soul to his spirt speaks of the totality of our   lives as black women and the full spectrum of kinship with   our fathers.    my soul to his spirit does not  bash fathers, however, it does   present a penetrating view from every possible angle. the six   powerful chapters, loving: daddy's girl; distant: every once   in awhile; abandon: one day he was gone; non-existent: could   pass me on the street; amended: time and forgiveness heals   all wounds; and deceased: gone too soon, cover the gamut of   emotions daughters have felt for fathers. i applaud ms. beaty   and all the daughters who contributed to this book of healing   and strengthening for the family unit. i venture to say each   reader will be familiar with at least one of the offerings.   this is a humbling read; an epiphany.     reviewed by ann  of the rawsistaz reviewers. daddy's little princess?	2
i have been reading book after book for my upcoming police tests and this is by far the best book for interviews. the information i have learned from this book applies to almost any interview not just the police one. i found that i had already begun categorizing people so i knew how to communicate in their language in my interviews for my small business. i am excited to try these techniques in the police oral interview. i feel extremely prepared for the interview thanks to this book. excellent resource!	1

"sad to say this book is an embarrassment to both psychiatry and the christian faith.  however, neither should be blamed for the nonsense of a man who claims to represent both.  there is so much wrong with this book that it isn't worth getting into.  i find it highly ironic, though, that peck is guilty of the same grievous sin and ""malpractice"" as the father of his character jersey.  jersey's father was a psychologist (not an m.d.), but use to put on a physician's coat when seeing patients.  peck saw this as highly offensive and evil.  yet he, a psychiatrist, had no qualms about pretending to be an exorcist and perhaps causing severe psychological, not to mention spiritual damage to his ""patients.""  if this book has any merit it lies in its ability to be a good case study on how not to practice psychiatry.  from reading his books i can't help but get the feeling that while peck sincerely wanted to help people he was too caught up in himself.  perhaps the enormous early success he enjoyed from ""people of the lie"" did a trip on his mind.  i hope he and all those he treated can find healing.  dominus custodit te ab omni malo: custodiat animam tuam dominus. voo doo doctor"	2
i thought that lahaye and blackstock would never be able to duplicate and certainly not be able to top the writing in the 1st book of this series.  how wrong i was!!  this book is even better than the first!   i can now relate even more to the characters of cedar circle, and i feel like they are my best friends.  i can hardly wait to turn each page so i can find out what happens next. i am anxiously awaiting the opportunity to read the 3rd book, because i know i won't be disappointed. even better than the first one!!	1
"ziegler certainly gives an inside look into the business, but for me, having been to two joe verde seminars, it came as nothing new. for someone new to the business, i'd certainly recommened it. for someone with several years in the business, it'd still be a very good refresher course. it's all too easy to get into a ""rut"", and this book can help you see where your mistakes are possibly being made, so that you can correct them. it would also be a good read for a car buyer, as it would give them a lot of insight into how some dealerships conduct business. nothing new, but a good refresher"	2
the new page edition of this book is a true piece of cr*p! every single page has multiple typographical errors, obviously deriving from shoddy proofreading of the text they scanned. i thought i could deal with it, but it reached the point where it was distracting, so i ordered the dover edition instead. i was an idiot not to get that one in the first place. don't repeat my mistake. the worst edition possible	0

if you want to read about scientific facts this is not the book for you.  the scientific underpinnings of this speculative book are briefly mentioned and not elaborated upon in much detail.  it's better to just read his paper on the somatic marker hypothesis (which is disputed by the way).  without a background in neuroscience it is difficult to evaluate his ideas in a serious way, and anyway he asks for introspection (a la william james) from the reader more than anything else. too much speculation	2

"one wonders by what process a review gets chosen for featured status.  i must concur with the unfavorable reviews.  warner treats the condemnation trial transcript as a privileged text.  she accords it all the authority of a definitive verdict from an impartial court.  it was neither.      it is unsound scholarship to attempt an uncritical reading of any trial whose conviction was later overturned on appeal.    abundant evidence confirms that the original verdict was rigged and that parts of its transcript were falsified.  warner barely acknowledges the retrial and offers little pretext for disregarding it.  this is the reverse of proper analysis.    if the twenty-five year gap between trials is an excuse for warner's preference, then consistency demands that warner accord still higher value to surviving letters from joan of arc's own lifetime.  she is not consistent.    a newcomer to joan of arc biography would do far better with regine pernoud's ""joan of arc by herself and her witnesses.""  pernoud's approach is to offer the reader relevant excerpts from original historic documents.  organized thematically, pernoud summarizes leading debates and invites readers to reach their own conclusions.  the work is admirably impartial.  pernoud is perhaps the most respected twentieth century scholar of joan of arc. begging to differ"	0

this is the best book that i have read about hemingway as a man. it doesn't pretend to be (and is not ) a biography. it is an intimate and  deligthful portrait of hemingway the fisherman, the hunter, the womanizer, the drinker, the gambler and all the things that really  meant something to him. were can you get such a descriptive account of the pain and insecurity associated with a writer's creativity?  without this book one cannot size the tragedy of a writer that, in his last years, was conscious of his inability to create great literature, but was condemned to live up to his myth and  his character. to those that criticize this book, on grounds of lack of objectivity, one must oppose that this is a book about papa like the one that he,  when paris was a moveable feast,  would have wanted to write about hemingway.........after all, if papa lived, he would have explained to all of us that time is precious and that he took hotchner under his wings, wined and dined and shared intimate thoughs and moments with him, only in order to provide the young lad with good story writing material. and hotchner has delivered. a portrait of a man	1

"i really didn't enjoy this tpb that much, and it definitely enforced why i'm not that fond of morrison's writing on any x title from marvel. he brings the angst to the characters, and he writes them intelligently enough, but he also makes me dislike all of them. even normally upright characters like jean grey and cyclops were so twisted i forgot they were heroes in this. yuck.    my main complaint is that i was hoping for a cleaner back history of wolverine's weapon h/weapons plus origin, and i really didn't get that from this at all. instead, wolverine's mission with cyclops is tacked on as an untidy footnote to three (or four, i lost count) issues focusing on the love triangle of emma frost, jean grey, and scott summers. i thought the title of the tpb was misleading because of that.     the opening issue continues jean's discovery of scott's psychic infidelity with emma. jean barges into his thoughts and finds emma dressed up in her old phoenix costume, which was kind of tacky and bizarre, anyway, when you consider that emma's old organization, the hellfire club, was responsible for jean turning into dark phoenix and subsequently destroying herself. my first thought was, why would that be a turn-on? very twisted scene. so, jean strikes out at emma, invading her mind and plowing through her most private memories as she searches for the first moment when they started their affair. emma stays in character, not feeling as though she had done anything wrong by offering scott salvation from his unhappy marriage, and calling jean ""a playground bully"" hiding behind her righteous posturing. pot calling the kettle...    that issue itself offered sympathy for emma from unexpected sources, namely hank and logan, both of whom i automatically expected to side with jean. in the meantime, all any of them did was blame jean for the dissolution of her marriage by ""not taking care of it sooner."" that alone made me not like this story.    this arc was kind of odd going in because it was sandwiched between arcs of the other x titles without reflecting anything that was happening in the others. bishp and sage were both fresh from x-treme x-men, namely ""schism,"" after solving the jeffery garrett murders in alaska. the second issue to this story arc features a murder mystery, since emma is shot and shattered while in her diamond form. i've heard readers comparing it to clue, but i don't give it that much credit, i thought the plotting was weak. i noticed that sage and bishop never once implicated storm, who not only hates emma, but who openly threatened her with hurling a spear at her carried by tornado-strength winds to see if she would shatter. hello? missed the boat there, grant. i'm guessing storm's name never came up simply because this wasn't her book. oh well.    the motive for emma's murder was kind of silly; two minor characters have a secret to hide in the farmhouse on the xavier property, and emma's prize pupils, the stepford cuckoos, know what's going on but won't spill their guts.    the weapons plus arc started with what was actually a satisfying confrontation between logan and scott at the hellfire club. the artwork was weird, though. i like bachalo's work on uncanny and new x-men academy, but he makes it darker, and the inks are heavy-handed. bachalo draws the ugliest cyclops i've ever seen, and his wolverine looks like a gopher. in this scene, cyclops tells wolverine that he refuses to come back to the x-men, but logan instead recruits him for a big mission with fantomex, an upgraded weapons plus graduate who clarifies that logan was really weapon ten, not weapon x as previously assumed. this was the most poorly written issue of this collection, and it jumped around too much for me to tell where the action was taking place. somehow logan and scott ended up on an asteroid, presumably with help from e.v.a, fantomex's ship. somehow they managed to escape, leaving logan behind to blow up the asteroid and destroy weapon fifteen. morrison and bachalo didn't even bother to pitch a knock-down, dragout battle between logan and fifteen that could have been the highlight of the story. it was a waste.    the jump from jimenez's clean penciling to bachalo's more cartoony style is very stark and does not work. i longed for frank quitely's pages instead, feeling he would have done a better job of conveying the images. as a lead-in to the much more important ""planet x"" arc (still not one of my favorites, but better than this drivel), this book was very weak.    overall, i'm sorry i spent the money on this story, and i will avoid morrison's back issues going forward. now i know why i didn't buy morrison's run..."	2

obviously, the rantings of a depressed, selfish and self-righteous woman, who for if these issues were not enough  of a challenge, believes in the fraudulent and assanine  thinking of freud. to bad she didn't kick the bucket before  she had the opportunity to launch such a demented attack on the very core of society, and what brings meaning to life: family.  this sad woman's physical appearance, almost confirms the above alone - just a miserable, frustrated witch. useless bunk	0
"there is much wisdom to be gained from aboriginal culture, but the ""wisdom"" in this book is not aboriginal, but rather made up by the author.  she should have based her book on real aborigines and shared their true culture, or based it on a totally fictional population.  that way readers would not believe the lies she tells about australia.  the book does make one think about the many flaws of our western culture which is good, but to do so while corrupting a native culture is simply appalling.  she should not be profiting from this book. very misleading book"	0
if you are a programmer and in a hurry to implement your own graphics filter then don't buy this book.  its treament of the various formats is essentially devoid of any examples and detail.  a very superficial book with large fonts a &quot;buttons&quot; fulfilling the need to ensure bulk to the book at the expense of content.  there is no cd with example coding and decoding examples, very very few tables of giving a graphical view of the file structures.   in short it is a poorly presented and poorly written book...hardly worth $10 rather than the $25 they are asking....go by the o'reilly book encyclopaedia of graphics formats...expensive for sure but it has what this book lacks and that is content. save your money	0
"this is the central question in featherstone's treatment of the dukes v. wal-mart stores, inc. class action lawsuit. focusing on depositions, sworn testimony and direct personal interviews, featherstone gets right to the heart of her subject in the first chapter. the anecdotal evidence, supported by ample statistics, demonstrates that something is, indeed, awfully wrong with wal-mart and the disparate ways in which it treats its workers.     as important as the gender discrimination issue is the consideration of how wal-mart has, and will continue to, build its fortune off the backs of the working poor. given enough time, it is entirely possible that certain areas of the country will be economically drained, committed to an addiction of buying at and working for wal-mart. it is the low-price panties version of a super size me world. worst of all, however, is the company's documented practice of referring its own workers to social service agencies, to apply for benefits they need because wal-mart neither provides sufficient benefits nor pays employees enough to afford them. puts a whole new spin on the phrase ""corporate welfare."" where is the politicians' indignation over this abuse of the welfare system?    well researched and well documented with references and notes. one latter chapter does tend to slow down with emphasis on legal citations and stats, but this is necessary to put a factual basis behind the personal stories. whether you are against wal-mart, a wally-world fan or a blissfully unaware consumer, you cannot read this book and remain unaffected in some manner. if it does not turn you completely away from shopping there, it should at the very least give you pause before opening your wallet. always lower prices - but at what cost?"	2
though this novel is supposed as a psycological materpiece i have found it to be sordid and incongruent. stendhal should have spent less time on his discriptions of julien sorel's superficial love endeavors and  &quot;rendez-vous&quot; and more time on his character's true personality.  after reading 508 pages i found the main character to be a complete  stranger. all that was revealed about julien was that he stuck to his  morals all the way to the end. stendhal should have learned from his  creation's ideals and stuck to the basics. a psycological mishap	2

it wasn't as impactful as i thought it would be.  some of the people that gave comments gave some great comments and others, well, other gave comments.  the selection of people was a good cross section but it didn't have meaning to it.  i was looking for more in depth commentary.  maybe what i was looking for should have been said between each of the comments in the book.  it might have looked like hugh just collected a bunch of email and old letters and thrown them together. two stars is being nice.	2

kahn did a great job in revealing vader's, luke's and palpatine's motivations and thoughts.  however, a glaring problem was where obi-wan tells luke about how he took him to live with his brother owen on tatooine.  i know that was the original backstory, but with the prequels' release, we all know that owen lars really is luke's step-uncle (since owen is anakin's step-brother).  lucas had the time to write that cute little preface in the re-release of this book.  he should have bothered to change or at least ommit this inconsistent dialogue from the scene.  this is a better storyline anyway, since obi-wan wouldn't have known his real brother well, having grown up in the jedi temple. excellent revelations, but lucas should have updated it	2
this is a very useful tool for real estate agents, & the letter templates are good. my only complaint is that they have a floppy disk included in the back of the book to download the forms onto your computer. if it had been a cd instead of a floppy, it would have been much better. nothing wrong with the material, i can recommend the letters, but some computers don't even come with floppy drives anymore. if they'd switch to a cd, then they'd have a winner. good book, but.....	2

alt ed is a very interesting book. it talks about all the stereotypes that teenagers have to put up with in high school. it shows how rude people can be to others. i liked how the kids had to get involved in the group. the group helped the kids open up to each other and to say what needed to be said. without the group i think a lot of the kids would have gotten into even more trouble then they were in. this book is great if you want to teach others about respect and stereotypes. respect! that's what this books about...	2

"i would not even give this book one star if i had a choice!  although some people state that this book may be informative and easy reading, and one poster even stated that it helped him pass a different exam, it fails miserably in preparing you for the 70-291 exam.  the book should have been titled ""some really really basic windows server infrastructure info and just barely scratching the surface of the 70-291 exam!""  the book was short and easy reading and i aced all the questions at the end of each chapter.  but when i took a real practice test by selftest software, i got 5 questions out of 50 correct on my first try.  not a good start for the exam which i wanted to take next week.  the questions on the practice test that i got wrong were not even covered in any respect in the book.  i've passed 70-290 and 70-270 and i can tell you that i know what to expect from a book and from the ms tests and this book does almost nothing for you in regards to the exam.  sure, it may be nice reading and it may have some interesting info, but if you are planning on buying a book to prepare for the 70-291 exam, skip this one.      i am going to reschedule my exam for a few weeks later and buy a real book!. a big waste of time for the exam"	0
such a wonderful book has been brought down several notches by employing a reader that puts one to sleep.  my travels are made signifacantly more enjoyable by listening to books-on-cd while driving. i've tried several times to listen to the civil war but had to give it up.  mr. whitener's voice is so drone and expressionless that i quickly loose interest.  sorry to be so negative, but this cd is very disappointing. stick to the book. an opportunity blown	2
i too agree with them, i am a pchem student, and the binding on my book is coming off, i need to tape it in order to save it from falling off.  yes, the derivation are hard to follow, my professor had to give hand outs on majority of them to show what steps were skipped. poor binding	2
"i have been a sci-fi/fantasy reader for over 30 years.  this book blew me away.  the characters were ""fully fleshed out.""  the plot, which would have come off as inane in less capable hands, resonates with, well, reality.  that's it!  emma bull got me to buy in to this story line - with all the ""diversity"" in the fey - and yes! it works.  i enjoyed it.  i loved the love story of eddi and the phouka.  all in all, a great, fun read.  what more can you ask for. the real deal"	1
"gonzalez's ""flash professional 8"" underscores a deficiency common to many flash instructional texts, where they spend half the book examining very basic subjects such as timeline-based animation and drawing tools. granted, this book does a nice job illustrating some basics to flash, but the level of discourse here does not inspire conceptual creativity. good books should lead to greater things, and not simply review the same basic subjects discussed since flash 4. one reason why books like this exist is that flash is poorly documented out of the box. yet any decent used book on flash mx will upstage this one.    while this book may lack instructional spirit, the most glaring omission is found in its actionscript chapter. ever since mx, the emphasis behind flash has been the power and flexibility of actionscript. granted, actionscript has become rather complicated, but a good author should at least prime the reader to the coding power available in flash 8. instead, we're treated to a weak smattering of script usage, without touching on the real power behind flash today: classes and object-oriented structure. as if that deficiency weren't glaring enough, the author provided examples of button coding that were outdated since flash 5! there is no excuse for such weak writing. you the reader deserve a better challenge to expand and hone your flash skills.    i'm giving this book special scrutiny because lynda weinman's textbooks have such visibility and apparent acclaim. while her books may be well marketed, they aren't always the best use of your money--or time spent reading. let me suggest a few texts which i have read personally and can recommend. if you want a good beginner guide, check out russell chun's ""visual quickpro"" flash books. more inspiring, project-related books are found under the friends of ed publishing line by sham bhangal. the most detailed and authoritative books i've read are colin moock's definitive guides, the other texts by o'reilly, especially those which touch on oop in detail. the last ones are tough at first, but they really open you up the power of flash. and that in-depth actionscript power is what your future employers will be looking for. good luck. lacks depth important to flash 8"	2
this is not a book for believers.  anyone of the jewish, christian or muslim faith should not pick up this book because you will be seriously offended.  mr. kirsh takes several biblical passages out of context to use  in his argument. his attitude towards anyone who believes is devoutly  religious and believes strongly in the words of the bible is extreemly  condeceding.  he says &quot;if you read the bible with open eyes and an  open mind&quot;.  therefore presuposing anyone who does not see things his  way is narrow minded. it was not until i got trough the first 30 or so  pages did i realise that none of the &quot;rave reviews&quot; he received  were from any clergy or religious orders.  further i realised that mr.  kirsch views are not stated out in the open.  you don't see his perjorative  view towards the bible, moses and god until after you've got into reading  the book.  i would only recomend this book to aetheists and others who are  contemptuous of the bible and the above faiths. not a book for believers	0
"i bought this book after i became acquainted with mitford sisters through a biography i have read.     after reading the biography, the first novel, ""pursuit of love"" seemed very familiar to me because in some parts it is almost a narration of the mitford history. some characters are given a different history but it is easy to recognize jessica or nancy herself.     i wouldn't go so far as to call these novels masterpieces but they are very witty and enjoyable. especially if you are an anglophile like me, you will most certainly enjoy this humorous depiction of upper class society in england.    both novels are narrated by fanny, cousin/friend to the heroines of the novels. ""pursuit of love"" is about linda's love affairs and ""love in a cold climate"" is about polly's scandalous marriage. both novels contain very enjoyable side characters like the bellowing uncle matthew, the health-conscious uncle davey and the lovable sissy cedric hampton. in fact the leading ladies are not explored so well as these characters. in the case of polly we know very little about what goes in her mind.     i must also note that these novels are more about characters than plots. nancy mitford writes along about the characters and when there is nothing more to say, she abruptly ends the novels. besides if you haven't read them one after the other, some of the points fanny makes will be quite irrelevant as in the case of fanny's meeting fabrice in ""love in a cold climate"" and mentioning that she will be adopting his son years later. first novel's heroine linda is just a distant character in the second novel but the other, funnier characters appear in both novels.    all in all an enjoyable read but do not expect a literary masterpiece. light and entertaining read"	2
i heard dr. wood speak in washington before i purchased the book and he is as eloquent in person as he is on the page.  it is difficult to discuss this matter in the public square given the emotional sensitivities in our society when one tries to talk about race, and no doubt many on the left will dismiss dr. wood out of hand.  but he gives a reasoned, thoughtful discussion on an issue that is still very central in our lives and society - but as dr. wood points out, if the left weren't so focused on &quot;diversity&quot; we would likely be much closer to the colorblind society we all seek.  an excellent and timely read. common sense amid chaos	1

jean-marie potiez has produced a wonderful book.  the fantastic photos (many of which have not previously been published) are worth the price of the book alone. the photos must have been very carefully selected: they are all, unfailingly, flattering and the band never look less than achingly glamorous.  the informative and enjoyable commentary, pieced together from a mind-boggling number of interviews, is clearly a labour of love and there are many surprisingly revealing and poignant quotes.  particularly sweet (and, ultimately, sad, given the couple's subsequent history) is frida's statement that the best thing that ever happened to her was benny, not abba.  the history of the ultimate pop group is traced on a year-by-year basis, from the mid 1960s, following the pre-abba careers of each member, through the romantic encounters, to the eurovision win, to the will-we-ever-have-another-hit? tension, to (phew!) world domination.  every step is lavishly illustrated with great photos.  abba's story reads like a film script -  humble beginnings, beautiful people in love, amazing talent, runaway success leading to a heartbreaking denoument.  there is even a 'where are they now?' epilogue.  this book wipes the floor with potiez's video documentary of the band (&quot;thank you abba&quot;). while it will certainly be a treasured luxury for abba's huge army of fans, this excellent book will also be of interest to anybody with an interest in perfect pop. your coffee table needs this book.	1
"i first read snow country more than 20 years ago and it has haunted me ever since. periodically i have to re-read it to see how age has affected my understanding. like most of kawabata's work snow country is a love story emphasizing, in restrained evocations, the evanescence of life and happiness.  shimamura, the central character of snow country, is a tokyo dilittante who breaks his ennui through his liaison with komako, a geisha and denizen of the hill country near niigata.  but his search for relief from his moral tedium succombs to his inability to have anything but aesthetic appreciation; he senses but he does not seem to feel.    it is komako's hopelessness amidst her instinctive love for shimamura that makes this story so compelling.  shimamura's ironic detachment from life, evident in his wholly aesthetic perspectives on everything ranging from western ballet (something of which though he has never viewed he has exhaustive knowledge) to pastoral vistas and the methodical attentions of a hotspring geisha, prevents him from feeling the love komako throws at him.  komako herself is confined to what the japanese call the mizushobai, or the ""floating existence."" this ""water-like"" life of women who earn their living through paid companionship in bars and resorts gives them a certain degree of freedom but can also resign them to loneliness and most often does.  while shimamura is attracted to komako, her status combined with his aesthetic perspective of her as a woman of the mizushobai dooms the affair as he takes to admiring a younger geisha called yoko.      it took kawabata nearly 13 years to craft this story into its final form. that long attention to writing the novel pays huge dividends. snow country is certainly one of the masterpieces of japanese literature, and it is the story that won yasunari kawabata the nobel prize. the crown jewel of japanese literature"	1

"""the book of j"" is an attempted restoration and critique of the original source document of the pentateuch. bloom first introduces the proposed author of this book - an original and provocative ironist, a lady of solomon's court, who has been totally misunderstood. the next section is a translation of the reconstructed book of j by rosenberg, who has also authored a brief appendix about the translation. the following two sections include bloom's commentary on the book of j, its narrative, personalities and themes.  this is the silliest book on the hebrew bible that i have ever read. it is obnoxious, almost totally unsubstantiated, and replete with simple misunderstandings of the hebrew text. bloom's somewhat euphemistic admissions that he is neither a historian (12) nor a biblical scholar (41) are the only parts of the book that i agree with.  he mocks religious jews, christians, the ""abominable jeremiah"" (176) and, with particular frequency, j's god. to the unprejudiced reader the god of the hebrew bible is majestic, awesome, and holy throughout, nothing like what bloom describes. the arrogant claim that the hebrew bible or its proposed substrate has been misunderstood for millennia by people devoted to it needs much stronger support than the speculation that bloom provides.  among other things, we learn that god sits in the terebrinths of mamre eating curds (12, 258) (a total misreading of genesis 18), that god loves david but not moses (41) (contrary to exodus 33:11-12 and numbers 12:7), that moses becomes the founder of circumcision (245) (contrary to genesis 17), and that god doesn't punish moses for good reason (34), without much explanation. however, we are told that traditional jewish and christian expositors are ""weak readers"" (34) and ""mad"" (246).  virtually no secondary sources are offered for the assertions made in this book, though we hear occasionally about noth, von rad and van seters, among a few others. to his credit, bloom mentions the opening words of cassuto's commentary on genesis (20), but fails to engage at all with cassuto's stunning rebuttal of the documentary hypothesis. i recommend cassuto's ""the documentary hypothesis"" as the perfect antidote to ""the book of j"".  not a shred of archaeological evidence is offered in support of bloom's assertions. other literature of the ancient near east receives no treatment. the content of the pentateuch places its composition firmly in the late second millennium bce, and its style and structure parallels other ancient texts of the near east of that time - until it is mutilated and divided into its putative sources. for the relevance of this evidence to the dating and composition of the hebrew bible generally, i recommend kitchen's monumental ""on the reliability of the old testament"".  bloom and rosenberg's transliteration is very inconsistent, and we're even treated to the non-existent form ""v'yhi"" (329). rosenberg translates from standard editions of the masoretic text; but i think that for a task like his a critical edition would have been better.  readers looking for an introduction to theories about the composition of the hebrew bible should look elsewhere. in my opinion, the documentary hypothesis is speculative, unsubstantiated and discredited by archaeological evidence, and the hypotheses of this book add assertion to assertion, and speculation to speculation. i do not recommend it. the book of junk"	0
boyd's revised edition of virgil's aeneid is the essential book to prepare for the ap latin: virgil exam or just become familiar with this favorite of all classicists.  with all the lines on the ap syllabus and no more, boyd's aeneid effectively prepares students to be familiar with all the lines that may appear on the test.  each page has a paragraph of latin text, with numerous footnotes underneath, offering translation help through grammar and vocabulary hints.  a glossary in back serves as quick reference to unfamiliar words.  while clyde pharr's edition has similar detail in footnotes and vocabulary, the pharr text contains all of books 1-9 only, meaning that students have to take home a heavier textbook and also purchase a separate text for books 10-12 of the aeneid.  thus, boyd spares students from searching for the passages that will actually be covered: it contains only what is on the syllabus.  it is a great way to study virgil's classic epic. new edition spares the frustration!	2

"the illustrations in this book, an artful combination of digital realistic media and traditional pen and ink are brought together in splashes of color and images that delight the imagination.  however, fantastic illustrations alone can not make up for a story line that lacks creativity and warmth.          an almost robotic tone takes the reader through a day in the life of our mischievous protagonist whose actions, such as ""showing joey whipple my underpants"" and setting shoes on fire using the sun and a magnifying glass go a step beyond acceptable childish pranks.  the story ends abruptly without closure and without endearing the characters which leaves the reader wondering ""what is the point?"". pointless"	0
"on the whole, i was drawn into rm's stories more quickly than pd's (my favourites are ""the sea king's son"" and ""the water horse""), although after repeated exposure i've developed some liking for two of his three. mckinley's stories herein seem to me to have more detailed and polished world-building. none of the six, to my knowledge, have been published previously.    ""mermaid song"" (pd) setting = very like puritan new england. (i'd have enjoyed it more if pd had simply made it an alternate puritan history.) while the mundane setting may be off-putting at first, the sea-people's introduction is well handled when it comes. in a way, this is two stories - a family tradition (handed down from mother to daughter) and the story of the protagonist, young pitiable nasmith, left with her maternal grandparents upon her mother's death in childbirth.    near the end of her life, pitiable's grandmother tells her the story behind the most unusual of her songs - how their ancestress charity goodrich really survived shipwreck upon arriving in the new world as a girl. although the people's culture isn't fleshed out much, the first contact scene between charity and her sea-children rescuers is realistically detailed. in a neat reversal of some sea-people stories, the air-breathing person was a pet, kept in an undersea cave with no way out.    the present-day story turns grim when the grandfather takes to drink after his wife's death, which seems to have quenched what little of his heart survived his daughter's passing. eventually he takes to walking along the seashore, and finds something that only pitiable has learned to recognize, shaping up to a possible reversal of the secret tradition.    ""the sea-king's son"" (rm) jenny, only child of a well-off farming family, grew into shyness as she grew up, and never let on that she had fallen in love with robert, a good-looking younger son of another farming family from a village on the far side of the harbour separating the small towns they live in - a harbour under a curse by the king of the sea people, to avenge an injustice inflicted by the land people in the days when the two races had dealings with one another (though only a trade in luxury items, never friendship, each race considering the other too alien to grow close to). but when jenny's parents make plans to send her away to the city for a season, in the hope that she might shake off her shyness, and perhaps find a good husband, robert finally makes a move - for love of jenny's inheritance rather than for her. but late in their courtship, jenny makes an unannounced visit alone to robert's family home, and what she learns there is more terrible for her than any ancient tale of sea-curses, and drives her onto the shortest road home - the direct route across the harbour.    ""sea serpent"" (pd) i was disappointed with the initial scene-setting, although the wave-riders eventually won me over a bit. the conflict between the new religion's chief god and the old's chief goddess comes to a head as the builder of a new temple seeks building stone taken from the goddess' shrine (which seemed unoriginal). the magic-working temple-builder forces the neutral wave-riders, worshippers of the sea god, to help transport the stones. the details of the minutiae, practical politics, and ethics of the wave-riders' work make the latter portion of the story a decent read.    ""water horse"" (rm) ""this island is a strange place...a threshold between land and water; and the boundary between us is striven for, and fought over, and it shifts sometimes this way, and sometimes that...it is over this one island that the war is fought, and if once we yielded, then all those lands behind us - farther from the boundary we protect - would immediately come under threat, and they have no guardians. we are the guardians; and here we hold the line."" so says western mouth to her inland-born apprentice, tamia, who began her training at fourteen as do all apprentices, and can't help worrying that she's not really suitable for the work. but western mouth was a very old woman by the time tamia came along...when western mouth has a stroke five years into tamia's apprenticeship, the defenses are torn open, allowing a creature of sea-magic to slip through that tamia must face in her guardian's stead.    ""kraken"" (pd) somewhat similar to ""mermaid song"", although the two humans swept into the water are saved by more supernatural means and for more complex reasons. the protagonist, a young sea-princess indulging in her last rule-breaking before coming of age, runs serious risks to try to return them to the upper air.    ""a pool in the desert"" (rm) the only damar story herein - not surprising, for a country bordered by desert in the more recent ages of the world. the protagonist, a present-day homelander (not unlike our own present), begins dreaming of a time so far in damar's past that it has become legend, and finds it far more like home than her parents' household, with their stranglehold on their children. six short stories (3 by each author)"	2
i always thought i was good at communication until i read this book (text book really). i was particularly impressed by the examples of emails that on the surface look fine until the writer points out the loop holes. despite its title this book comes in hand for many situations well outside business. i have also used my newly acquired skills in academic, political and philanthropic forums and received very positive feedback from colleagues who noticed a change. buy this book. an easy to read useful book and not only for business	1
i had heard wolfe described as america's premier social critic before i  read this book.  i did not come away disappointed as wolfe tackled many  issues in modern life from a proper critical perspective, ignoring ideology  in favor of reason.  he finds the flaws in both left and right, feminism  and laissez-faire capitalism.  written at a level where the average reader  can understand, unlike many scholarly works, this book still offers  in-depth analysis.  wolfe is certainly one of the more impressive authors  i've read lately. good coverage of many issues	1
"robert laughlin is a great physicist who has found some truly important insights about condensed matter physics in general and the fractional quantum hall effect in particular, and he deserves his 1998 physics nobel prize.    but his attempts to say something profound about fundamental physics and particle physics seem far less serious. be sure that my opinion is shared not only by a huge majority of ""fundamental physicists"" but even by many colleagues of laughlin in condensed matter physics. the main problem with his reasoning is that he has obviously no solutions for the problems he tries to address.     all of us agree that some important features of physical phenomena do not depend on the details of underlying physics; many of these phenomena are emergent in character; it is not too important or useful to know quarks or strings in order to study most of the important concepts in biology, climate, physics of water, or quantum computing. if laughlin thinks that other physicists do not realize this fact, then he is fighting a strawman. most physicists realize these things - and many fundamental physicists actually use very similar mathematical techniques as laughlin does in his ""emergent"" approach.    but at the same moment, there are contexts - and particle physics and/or fundamental physics is a textbook example - where we simply do need to ask different questions. we need to know what natural laws underlie the phenomena we observe at longer distances. we need to find more fundamental, more elementary, and usually smaller constituents of the matter and the interactions that control their dynamics.     we need to study these questions whenever we want to determine physics more accurately; we also need to study these questions because we want to acquire a deeper knowledge that is necessary for future constructions of emergent theories; we need to investigate the underlying physics in order to illuminate some features and parameters of the effective theories that the effective theories themselves simply don't explain and can't explain. people have been looking for more fundamental theories of the real world for quite some time, they have made a tremendous progress in this reductionist quest, and the reductionist approach is responsible for many of the achievements of the modern era. if there were no reductionists in the 19th and 20th centuries, electrons would not have been discovered and laughlin could probably never construct the wavefunction for which he was awarded by the swedish academy of sciences.    laughlin seems to misunderstand these points. he thinks that his dislike for particle physics is a valuable idea by itself. it's not. he has nothing to say about these issues, and therefore silence would be better for him and for everyone else. the same conclusion holds for laughlin's opinions about the black holes and other issues in the realm of fundamental physics.     laughlin seems to believe that the condensed matter physics way of thinking is very rare among particle physicists, string theorists, and general relativists, and therefore it is very important for him to present conjectures that the black holes are made of plastic or something very similar. but such conjectures are not too useful because fundamental physics simply does not work in this way. if physics of polymers were important for the research of black holes, it is very likely that the black hole physicists would be forced to figure out how to apply these rules even without the help of prof. laughlin.    the book uses many metaphors from the everyday life. the author usually offers ten sentences even though his simple and shallow idea is completely clear already from the sentence number one. several chapters at the end of the book are redundant as wholes.    you don't need to read this book. the main ideas can be summarized as follows: prof. laughlin believes that we should always be satisfied with a superficial description of physical phenomena and we should never try to look ""inside"" in order to identify more elementary components. prof. laughlin is wrong, he has nothing to say about the important questions that laughlin believes are unimportant, he actually says nothing about most of the important questions in the reductionist vs. emergent debate, and you better save your money and time. shallow ideas & deep misunderstandings"	2
this book offers nothing to someone remotely familiar with environmental issues.  it might be a mediocre read for a beginner, but if you're already familiar with overpopulation, mismanagement of resources, etc, you will get nothing out of this book.  it is incredibly repetitive and it lacks insight and depth.  don't waste your time. no new information	0

the criticism that a lot of the perfume and aromatherapy community has leveled at this book has been that there is nothing in this book that is not already in print.  i'd be willing to agree with that.  considering that chrissie wildwood is out of print, and that arctander and tisserand are hard to find inexpensively, this book is an okay stand-in for those which preceded it.  it is not the final authority however, despite the glowing reviews.  get the original works from these three authors if you possibly can, if you consider yourself a perfumery scholar. when talk is not cheap	2

as a convert from protestantism, i have struggled with the place of the blessed virgin mary in my personal spirituality as well as my defense of the faith. father mcbride's images of mary has been a turning point for me.  he has treated the reader as a thinking adult and as a pilgrim. his  synthesis of personal devotion with the writings of the church fathers,  church councils, and contemporary writers has resolved many objective and  subjective dilemmas for me. i have given the book to many friends. my wife  and teenage children are studying it with me. i am particularly thankful  for his tender use of iconography as way of catechizing from the heart. a balanced, loving history of devotion to mary	1

&quot;the aspern papers&quot; is a surprisingly short, sexy and suspenseful novel. it will completely change your opinion of henry james; he shows himself to be an master of suspense and well played out drama instead of the ambiguous pussyfooting plodder that most people think him to be. there is a definite touch of evil in this novella. it takes place in a stuffy interior world dominated by an old sinister woman in a green shade. the narrator's intentions are quite amoral and evil. the narration is deftly created through sure touches of insecurity and self pity. the trick of the unreliable narrator is used to great effect. and at no point does it seem anything other than a seamless and effective method of narration. an excellent introduction to henry james and his style	1
the book is useful, but i had to keep putting it down out of frustration.  many of the examples and images don't match up with the text, it's loaded with typos, and chapter 7 constantly references itself as chapter 6.  that's as far as i've gotten so far, because i *really* have to keep putting this book down out of frustration.  let me be clear, i'm not super-picky about typos and what not, but this book is ridiculous.  a few hours of proof-reading is all that would have been needed.  i'm honestly amazed it was released like this.  somebody needs to get fired over this.  it's that bad.  and no, i'm not exaggerating.    as far as how useful the book is, you can pick it up and leaf through to find a solution to whatever problem you're trying to solve.  but if the solution you find is affected by one of the hundred or so typos and mistakes, you might be setting yourself up for a wild goose chase trying to figure out why your code doesn't work like it does in the book.  ask me how i know..    also, note that most of the positive reviews here refer to the 1st edition. obviously a rush job!	2
i read this book because i really enjoyed southgate's the fall of rome. third girl from the left; however, is no fall of rome. southgate attempts to create a link between three generations of women from the same family by imbuing each of them with a love film. despite her valiant attempt, the stories just don't come together well. yes, each of the characters finds escape/ solace at the movies, but in spite of this common link, as well as the link of emotional distance between mothers/daughters, and artistic aspirations, there are too many distractions in the book to make it work well. southgate tries to cram too much into one book- a cursory look at the infamous tulsa race riots; an exploration of black women and lesbianism/sexuality; familial estrangement; and the history of the blaxploitation movement in film. an entire novel could be written about any one of these topics, but to shove them altogether in one novel, gives short shrift to them all. not exactly what i expected	2
this is one of the most disappointing knitting books i've ever purchased.  i expected patterns that would highlight the beauty of ribbon yarns but all i got were a  bunch of basic patterns for purses, halter tops, square cushions, etc.    author assumes that her reader does not know how to knit; at least a quarter of the pages in the book are how-tos that apply to any kind of yarn. unimaginative patterns; assumes reader knows nothing about knitting	0
"i read this book with enthusiasm and a new understanding of many of the integral buddhist concepts - even after having practiced buddhism for many years. the author brings some difficult and confusing buddhist tenets home and applies them to modern day examples which are easy to understand and grasp. my husband, a non-buddhist, found the book quite lucid, persuasive and enlghtening. anyone who is interested in an ""update"" and modern day application of this precious ancient philosophy will delight in and learn much from this book!. simple, clear and relevant presentation of the subject!"	1
even if you have other eclipse books at home, totality provides fresh information about this fascinating phenomenon.  this book describes in clear language what makes a total solar eclipse so special.  the authors explanation of the science behind eclipses helps to demystify the eclipse, while the chapter devoted to impressions from a group of dedicated eclipse chasers, gives a sense of the magic of a total solar eclipse.  there are plenty of drawings and photographs complement the writing, with an excellent set of references in the appendix.  highly recommended, jerry levy ... excellent addition to eclips-o-phile's bookshelf	1
"everyone knows the expression, ""ponzi scheme"", but i doubt many knew the derivation.  mr. zuckoff lays out its derivation in this terrifically readable book.    the real mr. ponzi immigrated from italy, moved around, being arrested in montreal and mississppi, before settling down in boston where he started a ""rob peter to pay paul"" scheme which now uses his name.    ponzi offered 50% return on investment in a mere 45 days in 1920.  mr. zuckoff points out how the american psyche was so ripe at the time for such get rich schemes.  ponzi took advantage of that mindset and in a brief period - just a matter of months - compiled a fortune.    it is truly unclear from the letters, quotes and litany of acts by ponzi whether he ever believed he could repay all his investors or was knowingly just trying stay ahead - one step before the law and one step in front of running out of money to pay investors.  certainly he could have fled back to italy at any time before getting caught, but he never did.  until the authorities caught up with him he was able to continue paying his high ball interest.  mr. zuckoff's portrayal of the con artist shows him to be so charismatic and colorful that the reader gets swept up into him just as his many boston supporters did during the ponzi-mania.  you almost have to root for the little guy.    mr. zuckoff also portrays the antagonists - whoops - the journalists and authorities that catch up to ponzi very well.  the editor of the boston post is another rags to riches hero of the book.    although this is, for the most part, the history of ponzi and scheme, the author paints a complete picture of the times in which he was able to perpetrate his scheme/crime.  this is what makes this book a more comprehensive history than just the telling of the scheme and how it was uncovered.      to make the book even more entertaining, it is written almost like a novel, with each page revealing a bit more of the story.    this very readable book is highly recommended. great yarn, great look at the twenties"	1
"a wasted effort from one on the most perceptive minds alive. he dropped his past standards on this book.  only the gems of wisdom about human nature gives it value.  an unknown author would have had this book rejected, or at least criticized.    i agree with the following observations taken from other reviewers:    ""the story was all over the place and the ending far from satisfying.""    ""the first hundred or so pages move at a glacial pace, and the author's disjointed manner of storytelling soon becomes confusing and annoying.""    ""far too much of the book took place in flashback... vacillating from vague self-pity to vague longing to vague regret and back... of the three pivotal characters, two are presented almost entirely in flashback.""    ""too dense and slow moving... even though the language is always wondrous.""    ""...novel seems dark and pointless.""    ""numbing dive into the depths of one man's self-absorption left me gasping for air.""    if you are new to le carre, read his earlier works first or you may never read them after this work. le carre's laurels don't rescue this book"	0

peter asmus is a sensitive, and involved, observer of the 20-year struggle to make wind energy a valuable energy resource.  this book describes the soaring victories and crashing defeats, with the personalities of the people adding more than enough color and life.  here are the words of one wind industry promoter who made the transition from dreamer to bank-financed developer without losing his pony-tail: &quot;kudos, and more kudos. you cut through all of our industry's    bulls--t with wit and candor, and injected living, breathing humanity into a story of technology. injecting your own personality, as well. despite the obvious that no one can ever tell the true story as it happened, you have done a remarkable job in bringing the wind industry's evolution to life, and the future of american, no, global, society, rests in your    readers' understanding of the lessons from your brilliant history of our industry.&quot; wind energy is now harnessed with modern machines in 23 states of the us. as we teeter on the edge of another energy crisis, this books describes what some people are doing about to improve the health and security of all people.  the beauty of this book is its invitation for everyone to choose the direction for the future. how to clean the air and reduce energy costs	1
"this is a fantastic study in the psychology of the mind of a megamaniacal dilettant who, like many of them, believe they are participants in, not just the scribes of, history. witness lines from goltz's book like ""it was my own little gesture at stopping world war iii"".    as a study of this under-reported conflict, unfortunately it's just about the only way to get any information at all in english, hence the two stars. and goltz is not only up front about his pro-turkic bias (his wife is turkish), he is honest about the failings of the azerbaijani government's policies, and reasons for loss of this war. there are a lot of facts here, in spite of what the more vituperative reviewers claim on this page.    the problem with the book is goltz's unbearable self-importance and flat tone of voice. goltz published an earlier book called ""requiem for a would-be republic"" from which most of this book is extracted. ""requiem"" has a very rushed (and amateurish)feel and ""az diary"" didn't even bother to correct that. maybe mr. goltz has read a little too much hunter s. thompson? or maybe he's rushing to meet some deadline? if mr. goltz is reading this, i would recommend he read michael herr's ""dispatches"" before writing another book.    mr. goltz also, the reader will notice, behaves like he knows the history of the region, when clearly he doesn't know anything but what he was told on the ground.    if you can overlook pretentiousness, absence of historical context and flatness of tone, there is some value in this book. if only a better and more imaginative writer had goltz's courage to be in azerbaijan at the time of the conflict.     i agree with other reviewers that mr. goltz is probably not a paid propagandist. there is no evidence of this; to me he comes off as just a sucker who got taken in by a cause not rightly his, and who wants, for personal reasons, to be the champion of a people he sees, rightly or wrongly, as victims of injustice. few options when it comes to this subject"	2

this novel was difficult for me to get into.  the noir speak of the book presented itself as a barrier to entry.  after training myself to think in terms of the language, i found myself so engrossed in the story that i moved through it at a steady pace.  definitely a darker novel but the character development was outstanding. not an easy read, but worth it	2
andy milligan was a terrible filmmaker, and his snail-paced movies, which blended trash and pompous period costumes, can only be called unwatchable. his final film, monstrosity, was truly the work of an incoherent brain, blending rape, hypodermic needles, and a grinning slapstick monster wearing a fred flintstone suit. mcdonough's book is fascinating at first, but then one realizes that these aren't artists being described with such misguided affection. like warhol's crowd, milligan's world was populated by uneducated drug addicts, and people obsessed with their own fractured sexuality. one of these days, there'll be a book about a true underground filmmaker, but in the meantime, we're stuck with the sniveling praise of sycophants like john waters, and books like this which glorify the excretions of talentless slobs. we need to find some better heroes.	2
the 30 second spot is dead.  the 30 second spot is dead!  the 30 second spot is dead!  alright, i get it already.  at least i did after the first 60 pages or so.  unfortunately this book does not end at 60 pages.  never have so many words been used to say so little.    the first third of this book (plus one chapter online) (parenthesis meant as a tribute to jaffe) tells you why the 30 second spot is dead.  to illustrate the demise of the 30 second spot, jaffe uses a dead horse and beats it repeatedly.    perhaps jaffe is quite funny and clever at a party, but his schtick gets a little old when trudging through 276 pages of his quips (plus one chapter online).  jaffe fashions himself as a modern day don rickles, passing out insults to everything and everybody who uses a 30 second spot.  unfortunately, this increases the page count of the book by about 90 pages.    the final two-thirds of the book is a survey of everything you can use instead of the 30 second spot.  jaffe says you have 10 options and he has designed 10 little logos for each of them (which you can see on his website) (again parenthesis meant as a salute to jaffe).  this is not any ground breaking information.  if you have been paying attention and made occasional contact with society, you will have realized that you can use the internet as a marketing tool.    mostly, jaffe's observations are re-hashes of stuff you can find in a trade journal or two.  and because this is an adweek book, i suspect most of this stuff was available in an adweek article.  the important thing about this survey portion of the book is that it gives you very little insight on how to use these tools more effectively.  it's just jaffe telling you that you are ignorant if you are not using his 10 alternatives to the 30 second spot.    save yourself $20 and get a subscription to adweek instead. pontification at its most verbose	2

"the previous post says nothing about the quality of this book and thus should be considered a definition of the xaml technology rather than a review.    in my opinion this book seemed slapped together. it was as if the tech writer of the documentation paraphrased the ms xaml help. there was very little usage of metaphor or humour to make the topic interesting or easier to understand.     the code examples are extremely simple and unimaginative. in one of the very few lame attempts at humour the author comments about an animated rotating square and states that, ""it may not be very useful, but it sure is fun to watch."" i found this attempt at humour insulting. can you imagine having a conversation with someone who talked like this?    if you are like me and you really like to have a paper version of bleeding edge tech stuff, you can be can be forgiven for purchasing this drivel. if you want to save yourself some hard earned cash, just download the ms expression interactive designer ctp and work through the examples. you will learn more doing this in less time. in fact, unless you are stuck on the bus, you are wasting your time with this book. slapped together - dry and boring"	0

this book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. the book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation.  if you do a lot of strength of material design i would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the mcgraw hill mechanical engineering design book which is an excellent p.e. exam reference book. stay away from the roarks formulas for stress &amp; strain book its more poorly written then the marks. better than roark's formulas for stress &amp; strain.	2

i just finished the historical atlas and while the book does a great job of touching on so many subjects in such a small space, it leaves a little to be desired because it does not focus on any one point in the city's development enough.  i would have enjoyed the book more if it had a little more detail on how landmarks came to be where they are, and what the political an social culture of the city was at different time points that influenced the way the city developed.  i suppose that wasn't the book's intent, though.  also, it would be nice to get a follow up chapter on the city's continued development since 1994.  overall, i thought the book was a good intro to nyc history, but i think i'm going to try a more in-depth history to fill in some gaps. good but not complete	2

this book had the potential to be very good but in the end, it is quite average.  the author's worst enemy is himself.  for some unknown reason, reidy feels the need to make some sort of joke or wisecrack once every six sentences.  this interrupts the flow of the story and, most importantly, the jokes quit being funny around page 12.  and on top of that, the constant attempts at humor create a sense that the author is lying about many things.      i am not sure why reidy felt the need to constantly make jokes (self-deprecating and otherwise) but it absolutely ruined the entire story.  after a while, you will begin to think he is making up half the stories he tells.  in all, a very disappointing read. a disappointing read	2

like many people, i bought this book to distinguish between a very entertaining movie, amadeus, and the truth. i am a musician and am very interested in truly talented and practiced musicians wether they be current or of historically mythic proportions. the effort and research in this book is excellent but, unfortunately, it is full of psychology and psychoanalysis which i'm not particularly interested in. it may be more interesting if it was proven data but these analyses are little more than guesses by a writer. how do you get deep, deep into the head of someone from well over two centuries ago? i'm sure some of solomon's conclusions are valid but i kept finding myself looking to see how much more of the book i had left to go so i could say i finished it and get onto something much more pleasurable. a hard, laborious read	2
"this book is a gem.  it centers on two acts of betrayal, one large, one not--yet, the small act of unkindness has remained with its perpetrator all his life.  wisdom seeps out of the pores of this novel.  and i must add that it's heartbreaking to read reviews like the one below by ""jmack"" who believes that the book ""does not deliver""--heartbreaking to think of how many other sublime works of literature he hasn't gotten.  sad.  in any case, do yourself a great favor and read maxwell [who was, all his adult life, a fiction editor at the new yorker]. after this one you can read, time will darken it and the volume of collected stories published near the end of his long life. hall of fame"	1
i liked this book for various reasons.  first, i thought it was neat for representing numbers through numerals, words, and dots.  it also  incorporated street scenes and common objects for the reader to see a  certain number of objects in an everyday situation.  i also liked how the  cover and some pictures showed children of different races together.  the  only thing negative comment i have is that the pictures are black and white  and not as attractive as more current books.  i think the book is  appropriate and a great way to practice counting. a teaching tool for counting from 1-15, 20,30,40...100.	2

"avorn's beautifully written book seems to become more important for ""the rest of us"" with every breaking news story about the pharmecutical industry. my suggestion in the light of the vioxx disaster? if you are interested in your own health and the medicines we take so casually, then buy a copy of this beautifully written and oh so revealing book.     let me give you a flavor of just how good a writer avorn he and how revealing this book is by quoting the way he introduces a chapter from this book:        ""in a former british colony, most healers believed the conventional wisdom that a distillation of fluids extracted from the urine of horses, if dried to a powder and fed to aging women, could act as a general tonic, preserve youth, and ward off a variety of diseases. the preparation became enormously popular throughout the culture, and was used widely by older women in all strata of society. many years later modern scientific studies revealed that long-term ingestion of the horse-urine extract was useless for most of its intended purposes, and that it caused tumors, blood clots, heart disease, and perhaps brain damage.""    this (sad) ""fairy tale"" introduces the whole sorry tale of hormone replacement therapy for women, and how badly the research was to defend it. the book just gets better from here. book for all to read"	1

"i'm giving this book two stars instead of three because the author felt compelled to waste so much white space on her leftwing, feminist agenda.  ms. harwood has published several articles on the supposed sexism of latin textbooks, and so litters her book with largely pointless textboxes containing ""gender-specific historical tidbits"" which she calls ""hysteria's herstory."" (something tells me that doesn't have quite the alliterative ring the author intended.)      likewise, what ms. harwood refers to as ""the christian church"" of the so-called dark ages is in reality the catholic church.  presumably, the correct identifier didn't sit well with her progressive sensibilities.    for an agenda-free discourse on latin, get the dummies book or stick with wheelock's latin 6e. harmful, hobbling ""hysteria's herstory"" "	2
"if you don't know much about ancient greek history or culture, this is the best short book i know of. on every page, in every sentence, the author gets straight to the point, with no fancy obfuscations, assuming no prior knowledge. i've never seen a better organized history of ancient greece. besides that, i strongly approve of the map selection and the timelines. he gives just enough depth to be a solid introduction--just a little bit more than ""what you're supposed to know.""     some teachers i know prefer a book titled ""ancient greece"" written by a team of authors led by sarah pomeroy. it has just a bit more depth than this book, but it isn't nearly as well written. it seems that they wanted it to be easily comprehensible, but i'm not sure they succeeded. it does have the advantage of a little more depth, but if you're reading for pleasure, i recommend this one rather than that one.    it is, though, only an introduction; that's the obvious downside of being short. you might want more information about the culture: more excerpts from the poets, the thoughts of the philosophers described in more detail, more plates (or plates in color) about the art. actually the book is amply illustrated in black and white. but of course a book dedicated to greek culture would have better information on any of these aspects, and that would be a book worth reading. this one serves only as an introduction. i strongly recommend reading the norton critical editions of the iliad and odyssey, hesiod, a couple famous tragedies (in my opinion, euripides' medea is the one to read first), and a few of plato's more famous dialogues. that is an introduction; but if that's the kind of thing you intend to do, this book will be a great place to start.    on the historical/political/social matters, this book is again a great introduction, but only an introduction. if you want more detailed information, especially a look at the reasons historians believe such and such happened, i very strongly recommend john v. a. fine's ""the ancient greeks,"" one of the very best history books i've ever read. of course it's a lot longer, but it's worth it. once again, if you're reading for pleasure, i recommend this one first, and then fine's book, which is a bit harder to follow.    if you want to read about greek religion, i would once again start here; but then you should read the classic, walter burkert's book, and follow it up with jan bremmer's book, both titled ""greek religion.""    of course, why not a little cheerleading for learning about ancient greece? since the renaissance and even more since the victorian era, anyone in the west who would call themselves educated has had to have basic knowledge of ancient greece. they were certainly very influential on western culture, and via bactria even had some considerable influence on east asia.     i've found that greek history somehow arouses more curiousity in students than modern european or american history. i think it's because of the nature of the ancient greeks themselves, because they reflected on human nature via their own history, so as we study ancient greece, we get to reflect on the nature of power, why governments take forms such as aristocracies or democracies or monarchies, why wars are won or lost, why empires rise and fall, how much blood and misery flow through history, and so on. students don't merely have to memorize lists of events and prepared ideas, but they get to reflect about life, why the world is the way it is, for themselves. and that is what most people, young or old, are all about. best short, complete book on ancient greece"	1
this book was my first exposure to the barbary pirates and that era of american foreign policy. it is a terrifically interesting period of american history. america,the young nation dealing with foreign policy issues in north africa where local muslim powers are capturing ships and demanding ransom. the bashaw of tripoli and his history with the politics of that region in the early 1800s is rendered more relevant given current events.  it is a truly human read with the strengths and weaknesses of those portrayed exposed. this is not sugar coated american history, be advised. tripoli and early american foreign policy	1
"the chapter titled ""aloha"" is central to waimea williams' book, both in its position and its importance. in it, she discusses what this word means to her, and to others.  she says, ""to lack aloha in even a small way meant being selfish, which was deeply embarrassing, and children accused of selfishness would correct this at once by giving stashed-away candy to a brother, or doing someone else's chores without grumbling."" for me, the most remarkable and beautiful aspect of this book is how it is, itself, a perfect example of ""aloha."" it's a memoir, certainly, and much that the author shares is distinctly personal, but her stories are starting points and illustrations - the book immediately expands beyond her own experiences to include many voices. missionaries, journalists, ancient rulers and taro farmers are all heard from. so is the honolulu phone book. every specific recollection opens up to broader thinking: the glamorous rita hayworth pays a visit to the coco palms lodge, or is it the goddess pele incarnate? this fits right into a discussion of the ancient ways, always right beside you in this place, and delivers us naturally to ideas about the contemporary globalization of traditional hawaiian religion. the book is about life in the 1950's but it encompasses what came before, and provides a way to understand what came after. for a memoir, this is a very unselfish book. the author has shared her stashed-away candy with us, and it's a treat. stashed-away candy"	1

"heard the cassette version of jackie, ethel, joan: women of  camelot by. j. randy taraborrelli and enjoyed it--in a guilty pleasure  sort of way.    it is a tell-it-all about the three kenney wives and listening to it  helped me relive some days of my younger days when john, robert  and ted kenney were alive and running for various political offices.    for some reason, i never followed too closely the dirt behind  their respective careers . . . yet this book more than made up for   anything i may have missed.    if everything in it is to be believed, i now know that joe kennedy  offered jackie $1 million not to divorce jfk and jackie allegedly   replied, ""the price goes to $20 million if jack brings home any  venereal diseases."" . . . also, that bobby had an affair with   actress lee remick who actually called ethel to tell her that they  were sleeping together--only to be told by ethel that he was  home in bed (when he was actually with remick) . . . and that  ted once showed up for drunk with a prostitute for dinner with  the king and queen of belgium, whose priceless antique coach  ted's date ruined by wetting it.    overall, the book left me feeling sorry for the kennedy women . . . although  they appeared so glorious from afar, how they were forced to live   their lives because of the constant spotlight made life anything   but easy for them. book you'll enjoy in a guilty pleasure sort of way!"	1

"i agree with the reviewers who found this series ""stuffy, predictable and annoying"" and advised, ""you might as well buy a romance novel."" (or a super-heroes comic book for the action parts.) what horrified me was that one reviewer mentioned peters in the same sentence with jane austen and the brontes!!  austen did not condone much of the absurdity and pomposity of her time, but chose to demonstrate it, rather than rant or lecture against it, as many authors and poets were doing.  in a few simple sentences she skewered inheritance laws' cruel unfairiness to women. the little girl asks, ""why do we have to move?"" and her mother explains simply, matter-of-factly, that's the way it is.  as outrageous as the law itself is the docile,(seemingly) unquestioning acceptance of it.  austen didn't go into an enraged diatribe, just assumed her readers were perceptive enough to get the message.  peters would do well to emulate really good writers: demonstrate talents and other qualities with actions and events, rather than repetitive, tiresome descriptions. i agree"	2

'random assasination of the king' thing wasn't done that well.  i had to read it twice, because i was like ""eh?  what the *heck* just happened here?"".  and the romance was something that you'd expect a third grader to write... the handsome prince suddenly shows up after a few hundred pages and it's all ""my love!"" and they haven't seen each other for what, a decade or so?  it's kind of ridiculous.  so all in all, it's something like three and a half stars for concept, minus two for execution.  but amazon doesn't let me do half stars. augh..."	2
my 2-year-old son loves this book! it has a wonderful repetitive rhyme that your child will love.  &quot;pigs in the mud in the middle of the rud. oh, no. won't do. gotta shoo. but who? i'll shoo, that's who, papa  said.&quot; my son especially likes when the grandma says &quot;ooooooeeee!  up to me!&quot; at the end and saves the day. cute rhyming story	1
we certainly live in a time of change. and it seems that even the rate of change is increasing. in this fascinating book, mr. kozak-holland draws comparisons between the problems that churchill faced in assuming leadership of the british government at the start of world war ii and the modern business world.     the changes in the military situation facing england were quick and sudden. the changes in the business world only slightly less so. consider, for instance, the marketplace for cameras. in a matter of very few years, the shelves at your local discount store basically no longer have film based cameras.     the author discusses a technique called adaptive enterprise that churchill used in modifying the way an organization behaves in the face of change. the comparisons are very interesting to a history buff, and have direct applicability if you are manufacturing buggy whips when henry ford comes along. interesting comparison between ww ii and business	1
"this book has 30 pages of obvious and worthless information. the book is very thin; when the box from amazon arrived i looked in the box and almost didn't find the book, that's how thin it is. of course it is quality not quantity that matters, and there too this book falls short. it was not written by a psychologist, in fact the educational qulifications of the author are not revealed. he is a ""management consultant to churches."" the average web page has more information than this book. definitely not worth the price. less content than an average web page"	2
"one of the many things i love about ""rosemary's baby"" is the magically timeless quality of the story.  yes, it takes place in 1966, but it could conceivably be anywhere, anytime, even perhaps right in your very own home.  aside from the brilliant story telling, i think that magical quality is one of the key reasons why the story remains popular.    it also goes without saying that the novel and film are both satanic masterpieces, filled with little nuances and gems that continue to reveal themselves with each reading / viewing.  an informed eye sees much.    however, this novel almost felt like a christian fanatic's response to the original story.  i don't know of the authors religous affiliations or lack thereof, but one gets the feeling that he ( like many others ) is trying to compensate for their diabolical work.    if you have any appreciation or love for ""rosemary's baby"", i offer you this advice.  accept rosemary smiling smugly as she rocks her baby in the midst of the coven as the ending of the story.      no sequeal was needed.    of course, you will read it.  i did myself in one evening, even as i told myself how much i would regret it later.

"as a collector, i love the quality presentation of this set of 5 stories. as a fan of the ducks, i just love the stories, and the superb art work.  i was kind of sure that i had seen the cover art under another name, something like the ""duck  family album"" but thats  not too significant, since the art-work presents the characters from inside the set of stories. probably the best thing in the structure of the stories is the way each layer flows into continuous action.  ""mocking bird ridge"" shows classic donald, the wily  gladstone gander, the nephews, all pitted against the ever money-wise uncle scrooge. of course, few are the times that scrooge loses out ( since, as everyone knows, his lucky ""number one"", takes care of his money skills).it's a classic setup, with a wonderful denoument.  ""a sticky situation""; i must admit to having no immediate memory of this great story. the nieces look like they are early on in their design phase, but appear to be a parallel to the nephews. the only similar story i was aware of is a diary narrative, same as this  story, done as an animated valentines day special. it's massive fun, and shows daisy and the nieces in full form, with daisy's come-uppance  against donald being perfect poetic justice.  the ""grandma  duck"" story is a great venue down on the farm, with gus goose being the prime mover, as always, by almost total accident. it's a great story with a totally sweet, but not saccharine, ending.  ""jonah gyro"": this is a variation on a theme that gyro has done at other times, but the fishing technology he develops not only has the other fishermen jealous and angry, but provides for a hilarious series of events for the masterful gyro, who proves that if he can, he will, and you will be entertained by it !!!  ""go slowly sands of time"": absolutely superb in every way. a brilliant story that has the ducks cross the world, and only to discover that they had the secret right at home; as ever, the fun is in the journey, and this is another part of a great set.    the paper is first rate. the binding is great, and the quality in all respects is tops. a great buy for anyone who wants to keep this material for a long time ... another great reprint of the gladstone title.  [ also: kudos to amazon !!! i ordered this on  friday the 4th of november, and it arrived  tuesday 9th november. totally awesome delivery time, and is getting consistent for amazon. both of the items including this comic, arrived in great condition, and considering it was usps, intact !! maybe i got lucky, but it's stuff like this that give me a better experience cost and value wise than any other local shop around... thanks  amazon !!!!!!!!!!. classic collection of ducktales"	1
peter robinson has turned into a first-rate mystery writer. but he certainly wasn't when he wrote this in 1989. no amount of gorgeous yorkshire scenery can make up for an uninteresting cast of one-dimensional characters and an abrupt. out-of-left-field ending.  skip this atypical entry and read  his later inspector banks books --they're first rate and well deserving of all the acclaim and slew of awards he's won.  this isn't. don't let this one lousy book put you off robinson	2
i thought that this book was o.k. for the most part, but i really didn't like some parts at all. what really gave the book a bad effect was what lavaughn finds out about jody. i think that kind of ruins the book. i was very sure that she was going to talk to jody, or something, but after she finds out the true thing behind him, i think it was a total waste of writing. i don't really reccommend this book to anyone, it had a nice writing style, but the actual writing wasn't that great. not the best~ eniz	2
i belive that the author of this book is blaming society, especially universities, a little too much.  in the beginning when he makes this assertion that universites are racist he basis it on the astute obervation  that since there a few african americans in the universities that they are  racist or something like that.  furthmore since the military has more  african americans it is a better instiution.  here is a better explanation.   universities are a lot more selective and thus can choose from the entire  population.  the army will take anyone it can get its hands on. i just did  not like the authors atitutde that the whole is racist. furthermore he  knows nothing about music.  i love when he writes white soldiers are  listening to more black music and he uses heavy metal and rock n roll, both  white music!  in fact heavy metal is white protest music against black  music!  do some research or think before writting a book. uninformed	0
"as a lover of all things glacial (with antarctica holding a particularly special place in my heart), i was thrilled to come across this book in my local library. the book promised to deliver an enjoyable blend of history, science and culture in an entertaining travelogue format. sadly, i soon found myself disappointed. by the time i was halfway through, i was struggling to make progress through what should have been an engaging read.    wheeler suffers for the most part from a lack of direction. her ""travels"" consist of spur-of-the-moment helicopter rides to various locations on the ice that fail to be distinguishable after the fourth or fifth trip. indeed, at times the book reads more like segments of a blog interspersed haphazardly with snippets of polar exploration history or the odd fact about glacial ice or penguins. this is further muddled with somewhat contrived musings on american culture (they're all depicted like they're ex-cowboys from texas), or anomalous personal asides that try to be meaningful but come across as undeveloped filler material.    individual chapters have no particular structure or purpose, and so the finished product feels a bit like slogging along through the variations of the same thing: funny anecdote, helicopter ride, historical bit, description of another station's toilet facilities or the food they eat, personal aside. after several chapters of this jumpy, disjointed writing style, following the narrative stops being fun and feels more like work. this is unfortunate; wheeler's writing isn't necessarily poor, but seems to suffer from a bad editing job and a lack of planning.    the anecdotes are amusing, the history fascinating, but when it comes to the science and the researchers themselves wheeler largely fails to make a case for their relevance. instead, they come across as slightly eccentric guinea pigs with odd-but-quaint obsessions. still, perhaps the book's greatest crime is that she largely fails to capture the beauty and utter wildness of this last frontier on earth, and in the end i felt no closer to antarctica than when i first picked up the book.    ~ jacquelyn gil. stumbling to the south pole"	2

i agree with the reviewers who've described this as a slow read. no argument there. but it's also a very important 18th century work and one essential to anyone interested in the literature of the period.  if you read the book with an ironical slant it's much easier to see that there is actual humor in the often improbable situations. granted, it may not be laugh out loud humor, but it is there. the poor vicar is modeled on the biblical job, to a very exaggerated extent.  it's so exaggerated that the modern reader will likely be rolling his eyes, i know.  if you're looking for tight plot and fast pace this won't be your book, but those reading 18th century literature will realize the novel was much different at the beginning that it is now.  you don't read the vicar of wakefield for the plot. you read it for the study.  it remains an important book. an 18th century essential	2
"i've read this book several times, and i would place it second only to jehovah unmasked in its impact on the watchtower sect. i am a former jehovah's witness who attended the international convention of jehovah's witnesses in chicago in 1969. i was there when then-president of the watchtower society, nathan homer knorr, announced to the audience that ""1975 marks the end of six thousand years of man's existence, and begins the seventh millennium since adam's creation. this seventh millennium will run concurrently with the one thousand year earthly reign of jesus christ. therefore the great tribulation and the battle of armageddon must occur sometime before 1975!"" this prediction can also be found in old watchtower books no longer published by the society, such as the ""freedom of the sons of god"" book.    the jehovah's witnesses of today are either unaware of this 1975 prediction, or they swallow the watchtower lies about it. when i was a witness i was taught to ""lie for the truth."" this practice was called theocratic warfare. the idea is that it's commendable to lie in the furtherance of ""the truth."" this oxymoronic hypocrisy goes right over the heads of jehovah's witnesses. anyway, that's why jw reviewers of this book lie and say the watchtower high command never made a prediction about 1975. the watchtower society has even managed to get some of the witnesses to believe that it was the lowly witnesses themselves, the rank and file, that made this false prophecy, not the brooklyn oracles (watchtower high command). talk about mind control!    so, crisis of conscience is a marvelous nail in the coffin of the watchtower cult and it's mounting pile of dead children whose parents denied them life-saving blood transfusions. as well as the growing scandal of pedophilia as more and more watchtower ""elders"" are exposed as pedophiles. the watchtower high command shields these sexual predators from prosecution, and instead disfellowships the victims of watchtower sexual abuse!    jehovah's witnesses promote ignorance, superstition, medical quackery, and encourage pedophilia by covering it up and punishing the victims! the watchtower high command controls every aspect of a witnesses thinking, telling them they cannot vote, cannot join a political party, cannot join a union, cannot join a lodge, cannot serve in public office, cannot serve on a jury, cannot join the armed forces, cannot salute the flag, cannot celebrate holidays, cannot celebrate birthdays, cannot step inside a church even to attend a wedding or funeral of a non-witness loved one. they forbid jw's from reading any religious material other than their own, and even forbid married couples from engaging in oral or anal copulation. they work hard to keep women ""in their place"" and even strongly admonish their youth against going to college, preferring to keep jw's ignorant, credulous, and malleable to their will. all of these prohibitions (and hundreds more) carry the punishment of shunning, complete ostracism, from the group. this winds up destroying the lives of witnesses, and tears whole families apart, when they can no longer speak to their loved ones, nor their loved ones speak to them. the watchtower high command (the 'governing body of jehovah's witnesses') knows nothing of the grace and love and mercy of god, but are the most harsh, merciless, pharisaic, legalistic, mean-spirited, judgemental group of bitter old men with delusions of grandeur ever to walk the earth!    i was trapped in the watchtower religion for four long years. i know whereof i speak. it is an un-american religion that exercises far greater mind-control and life-control over its members than even the pope does over roman catholics. yet the witnesses condemn the pope for dictating dogma to his people. the witnesses are unable to see this double-standard, the hypocrisy. they're blind, as all religious zealots ultimately are.    so, by all means purchase crisis of conscience as well as jehovah unmasked! for a one-two combination to the face and head of the watchtower high command. you should ""pity the fool"" who becomes ensnared in the watchtower cult or has been raised in it, for they are a slave to the watchtower and exist to do its bidding. thankfully, the jw growth rate has slowed to a crawl and young people raised as jw's are abandoning ship in record numbers! :)    would you like me to go into more detail as to why crisis of conscience was penned? i will assume the answer is ""yes"" and will extrapolate.    ""demons"" inhabit the literature of non-jw christians according to the watchtower high command, so witnesses must be careful not to touch it and never read it. ""you never know when a demon might be lurking inside a gospel tract, just waiting to invade your body and mind!"" so witnesses are told never to read or even touch any books or literature from other religions. in reality, this is a transparent ploy to make sure the witnesses are ever exposed to what non-witnesses have to say about the failed prophecies, doctrinal flip-flops, and theological somersaults regularly engaged in by the governing body of jehovah's witnesses. the watchtower society holds it's slaves in the steely grip of the primitive fear of demons.    the watchtower society strongly discourages it's slaves from owning a personal computer or surfing the internet. their ostensible explanation is again ""demons."" the demons will infect your sin-infested mind if you dare to read anything on the net that displays the failed prophecies, doctrinal gyrations and theological flip-flops of the governing body. this is also why jehovah's witnesses are strongly discouraged from reading old books the governing body no longer publish. they don't wish their slaves to know how much their doctrines keeping mutating and evolving into one monster after another.    the watchtower society claims it speaks for almighty god himself, and you'd better believe what they say unquestioningly, and obey them explicitly, or you are doomed to be destroyed in the battle of armageddon. therefore, jesus christ isn't the savior of the rank-and-file jehovah's witnesses, the governing body is! the governing body officially and openly teach the ""earthly class"" (the rank-and-file jehovah's witnesses) that jesus christ did not die for them, but only for the anointed class of 144,000 who will go to heaven. also, even though the watchtower high command claims to speak for god, and insist that rejecting their words will insure your doom at god's hands, they claim they aren't divinely inspired! the watchtower high command tells jehovah's witnesses, in the pages of the watchtower magazine, that they speak for god almighty himself. then on the next page they declare the exact opposite, and claim they are just poor imperfect folks stumbling along just like the rank and file witnesses, and are not inspired. right after claiming to be god's earthly representatives, speaking for god almighty!!    so, the brooklyn oracles have it both ways. they demand unquestioning and total obedience as god's earthly representatives, but plead ""imperfection"" and say ""but we never said we're divinely inspired"" when caught in a failed prophecy or doctrinal flip-flop. which happens a lot throughout their history. old discarded doctrines and failed prophecies are called `old light' and today's doctrines and prophetic speculations are called ""new light."" the problem is that ""new light' quickly becomes ""old light"" and often even ""old light"" becomes ""new light"" again! people who have been shunned (and therefore become as one dead to their families and friends) because they didn't submit to some ever-changing watchtower flapdoodle, are never apologized to or allowed back into the group when the doctrine is rejected for something new. the watchtower high command are callous old fools with delusions of grandeur, squirted full to bursting with hubris.    going door-to-door and obeying every whim of the watchtower society is how the earthly class of jehovah's witnesses prove their faithfulness to jehovah and thereby earn salvation. they are taught they are not saved by jesus christ. they are taught that if they have any chance at all at salvation, it will come by belonging to the watchtower society and believing it unquestioningly and obeying it explicitly. so, don't admire witnesses for their zeal. they're just trying to earn brownie points with god by fearing and obeying what they mistakenly believe to be god's mouthpiece. in reality they don't really care about you. they only care about saving their own hides.    the governing body of jehovah's witnesses have passed thousands of ""theocratic laws"" about everything one could imagine. from banning blood transfusions, oral and anal sex even between married heterosexuals, to prohibiting such things as celebrating holidays or birthdays, voting, holding public office, serving on a jury, saluting the flag, or going to college! to list the thousands of laws they have enacted against their slaves would take hundreds of pages. if you think the orthodox and chassidic jews have a lot of religious laws, you'll change your mind if you study watchtower literature.     even when i was a witness, i knew that some of the watchtower pronouncements were quackery both medically and theologically. such as the blood transfusion ban. i'd never been able to take seriously their belief that ""the soul is in the blood"" but went along with it rather than be ostracized. to jehovah's witnesses it is literally a matter of life and death. a lot of witnesses (including children) die because they refuse blood transfusions. in the past, the watchtower high command has enforced other types of medical quackery upon the poor victimized jehovah's witnesses, including ridiculous ""cures"" for cancer that resulted in the deaths of many witnesses.    don't just take my word for all this, buy and read crisis of conscience and jehovah unmasked! both are fascinating reads. don't delay !  order ""apocalypse delayed"" today!"	1
this by far is the weaker book in the whole ender/bean saga, but this isn't due to card losing his stuff or anything quite that dramatic.  the fact of the matter is that this is the last two hundred or so pages of book 6.  before the story could move anymore (spoiler spoiler spoiler) achilles had to be killed.  i'm guessing that adding that to the sixth book would have made it longer than the publisher liked, and thus what was probably one hundred pages of story had to be fleshed out, and thus diluted.  i just finished reading book 8 and let me tell you that this was a wholly necessary step in the story.    as for the lack of science fiction, i can admit that it isn't totally traditional sci-fi at this point, but it's still got most of the characteristics.  anything in the future, after alien bug invasions, with colony worlds, and faster than light communication, well yeah that counts as sci-fi to me.  i think the biggest problem is that card is a total sci-fi guy, and when he tries his hand at romance it comes off like a bollywood movie.  and the babies thing, the emphasis on having tons of babies, is a natural reaction of the characters to the end of the birth control laws.  that probably explains why there seems to be an ongoing breeding infatuation.      anyway, this book is good, but the others are great.  but we need all in the series to make it work, so this one does it's job well enough.  it can't live up to the intrigue of the others, but it makes the eigth book possible.  and the eigth was really worth it.  at least we can be thankful that they haven't become as whacked out as the last two ender books. a three hundred page punctuation mark.	2
ok when i first read this book i was 9 years old and after the first time i found it my local library i was never able to find it again because i forgot the title and the author but i never forgot the story or the beautiful artwork. now that i'm 19 and there's now the internet to use, i'm happy to have found this book again! i've been looking for this book for 10 years, it is worth the search and will be memorable to any child who reads it. ^_^. a story to be remembered	1
this book should never have been re-released.  it is that bad.  save your time, money, and vision.  none of the characters are believable or likeable.  meredith's story might have worked if she made her vengeful return to billings after 10 or 15 years instead of 6.  i have been in the boardroom of a national corporation and 22 year old mothers do not have the depth and experience to head a domestic division even with an mba.  not to mention her unfamiliarity with society and lack of professional allies in this rags to riches story.      cy is totally appalling.  why would anyone trust him in business or in bed?   and yet our heroine falls for him over and over again.  how stupid.  how could he live with his mother for 30 some years and never ask about his grandmother or his relatives?  how could everyone in town have forgotten who she was if she grew up there?  and what about the mysterious mr. smith?  although called a bodyguard, he acted only as a babysitter.  he could have been interesting.  wasn't he worth a story line?  he did not even rate a first name.  unbelievable.  this book was too, painfully long with characters i never cared about.  it was torture to read.  even the sex was bad.  for people whose attraction was based on mutual passion it just came across as horny sex.  put this one back in mothballs.  and diana, do not be afraid to write about a mature woman.  love and sexual satisfaction can still be a discovery for women over 35. the worst of palmer	0
"i am a fashion designer who was looking for some good resource books to help with figure-appropriate designs.  i came across this book after a long search and thought i had found gold.  unfortunately, it was not what i expected.  i was really disappointed with the line sketches used to explain clothing choices and found those designs to be very outdated- especially considering the second printing was in 2002.  for example, i could not disagree more with the advice for rectangular-shaped women- that they should opt for sack dresses that ignore the waist, rather than trying to create one.    the chapters on jewlery choices and color charts were equally useless.    i would not recommend this book to any fashion designer looking for figure-flattering design elements.  ""dress your best"" by stacy london and clinton kelly is by far a better choice- especially considering the price. if 'unuseful' were a word, i'd use it."	0
this book was more than helpful for step 2.  in particular, it helped me polish up on dermatology, ophthalmology, neurology, and radiology - subjects not well covered in the other review books i used, and subjects which had an appreciable presence on usmle step 2.  it also helped me review ob/gyn at the last minute.  look out for errors, though - others in my class found flaws in the medicine section, for example.  otherwise i'd give it 5 stars.  worth the price for all the high-yield information packed in this little green book. concise, 1-book review for step 2.	2

while the murder mystery was well set up, the ending was more of agatha christie ending, with a parlor room scene and a head shaker of a perpetrator. the political intrigue which should have been the height of this story was not focused on well enough. this is a society in the grips of an awful set of diriving forces that should have rocked the foundations of the planet. but you didn't feel that pain from the governor. the 4 law robot introduced isn't given the same exploration that caliban was in the first book. you do not get behind his head. the pain of transition should have been brought to bear hear as their are real world examples all around us. this missed the boat. the sequel should have been better, but was not	2

some may feel that the ability to be a smart decision maker and one who resolves their personal matters in wise ways is something innate to the being.  david a. welch's guide explores the procedural manner in which one can learn to become a more effective decision maker for both large and small dilemmas in both personal and professional situations.  welch has authored several books examining war and the cuban missile crisis and is an associate professor of political science at the university of toronto.  in the first chapter of the book, he looks at the ideal situation for decision-making and discusses the constraints that effect our decision making in the real world using everyday examples.  welch breaks down the steps to effective decision making into nine steps.  in the second chapter, welch explores many different types of decision-making situations and the different strategies that could be used depending on what type of decision is being made.  in chapter three, welch decisions that can be quantified such as any decisions that involve money.  in chapter four, welch discusses the effects of people's emotions, judgments, and perceptions on their decision making process and the importance of being aware of these personal biases when making a decision.  chapter five is devoted to philosophical issues and moral decision-making.  in chapter six, welch explores the belief that decision-making styles of women and men differ specific to their gender.  finally, the book discusses habits and the importance of developing a strong decision making style in order to overcome an ineffective decision-making style.  this book was extremely informative and used many everyday scenarios that made the reading applicable to business people as well as household decision makers.  in his approach to decision making, the one who analyzes and presents options for resolving the problem situations is also the decision maker.  therefore, it is important to acknowledge personal biases, gender issues, and moral issues, which do affect the decision-making process as well as the decision that is made. success science	1

the stories collected in this book offer the promise of exciting stories dealing with the knights templar, a topic that begs to be handled intelligently in fiction format. what the reader gets instead are weak 20-30 page stories that offer absolutely nothing for the reader that may intrigue, educate or even entertain. the authors who contributed seem to be accomplished writers in their own right, but that is not evident with these stories. some are poorly written (such as &quot;the city of brass&quot;) and others deal with the topic of the templars in ridiculous ways. one thing that really bothered me was the addition of kurtz's short story that takes place within the story of her own series of books! basically, i would have to read her books to make even the slightest sense of the short story. very poorly thought out. the best thing about this collection (and the only reason i gave it two stars) were the interludes between stories, which offered up some basic info on the knights. definately not worth buying this book for, though. mediocre collection of short stories	2
i'm new to crime analysis but what i have read and been able to put to use, the information in this book is great.  it doesn't go into depth but covers the many areas of crime analysis and gives a good bibliography.  for beginners like me this is a great book. just beginning	1
"i'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing the horse whisperer a couple of hours ago.  i'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else.  not only are marriages broken, but trust between parent and child.  i'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character ""can not control,"" ""just feels right,"" etc.  and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best.      i am saddened that these people do not understand what love is, or for that matter what marriage and a family are.  the pain and heartache, the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing.  i'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book.  i think that all i need now is to hug my sweet, honest husband and dear children, who know that the greatest gift i can give them is to love their father.      that is all.  my vent is over.  thank you. ruined my day"	0
i read the book on a flight from phoenix to denver with time to spare.  the chapters are well organized and the material is reinforced to the  reader by the use of worksheets and a self-test.  though the depth of each  of the topics covered is not extensive, the scope of the topics and the  logical way they are presented allow the reader to develop a good grasp of  the gist of project management.  i am looking to make this book a mandatory  read for employees going through our company's project management  curriculum. a fast read that is both informative and concise.	2
"this epic work is currently being referenced repeatedly as a cautionary tale of what the u.s. should be careful of in iraq.  superlatives like ""history at its best"", ""an all-time classic"" and ""superbly accurate"" are being tossed around carelessly to describe alistair horne's history.    in fact, it remains a remarkably racist work loved by state department officials and neocons alike - similar, but not quite on par with, the racial hatred on display in that other state department favourite, the arab mind, by raphael patai.    in this work, alistair horne describes in gory detail atrocities committed by the fln, or algerian nationalist rebels, while skimming over far worse atrocities committed by the nice white-guy french.      atrocities are not to be ranked, measured, and compared, but horne's bias becomes transparent when he describes in detail and over several pages the killing of 100 french - a tragic and ugly incident, no doubt - but then blithely mentions in passing, without flesh-and-blood detail, that the french killed 6,000 algerians in response.  six thousand!  most of these were summary executions of unarmed prisoners, a common french tactic, and many thousands of the civilians murdered were toddlers and elderly women.    this is but a glimpse into the sick mind of alistair horne, who manages somehow to see the french as victims.  he deplores the damage to the french psyche caused by their torture of thousands of algerian civilians, without once considering the damage the torture had on algerians, the actual people being tortured.      horne makes cursory mentions of barbaric acts committed by the french but never draws the conclusion that french society itself may have been perverse, twisted, or morally sick.  yet, he has no hesitation in expressing that algerians' behaviour proves that they are somehow subhuman, or less human, than europeans.    in short, this is a good book to read to understand how once upon a time the french, like the americans today, felt themselves infallible, civilised, and racially superior to arab and other ""primitive"" peoples.  it is an illusion that must be fought.    another reviewer on this site mentions that horne's book covers ""islamic terrorism"", but no such phrase is to be found in his book.  contrary to what most americans believe today, so-called ""islamic terror"" is not an eternal and everlasting feature of the modern world; in 1977, when horne wrote this work, there had yet been no iranian revolution, no soviet invasion of afghanistan (and hence no al-qaida), no israeli occupation of south lebanon (and hence no hizbullah), and no israeli-supported creation of hamas as a counterweight to the secular plo.  therefore, no such concept of ""islamic terrorism"" existed in horne's mind or in any other person's mind in 1977.  it is a failing of the human mind to write current events into history; american journalists employ it as their favourite agitprop tactic. a savagely racist work"	2
this guide is probably one of the worst ever. the chapters all look alike. it takes more time to look for what you need in this than to beat the game. the game is pretty simple anyway, so it's not really needed. if you do need help, find an online strategy guide, but save the $10 for something more useful. good game, awful guide	0
i would only suggest this book if you have a lot of patience and determination to make sense of the authors code.  the source code has bugs, and many many memory leaks.  it isn't even formatted correctly. in order to make sense of it, i had to tab and format it correctly. not fun.  there are much easier ways to do animation than what the book describes.  if you really want to know how x files work then get this book, otherwise skip it. not a great book	2
"this is a must buy book!!!  a classic in every sense of the word.  ms. mitford did a wonderful job when the work was originally published and the ""revisited"" portions are great too.      as a casket distributor, i have a fairly unique perspective on the funeral business.  funeral directors provide a very necessary service to society and are worthy of our praise for their work.  that being said, some of their practices are manipulative at best.  for example, i sell caskets directly to the public, and even though it is a consumers right to purchase this item directly from an independent casket retailer, funeral homes try their best to steer consumers toward their own highly marked up products.    ms. mitford breaks the whole process down in an informative and entertaining manner.  i think you will enjoy her work.  my website  www.sacredvessel.com has some great consumer protection related information if you are looking for additional resources.  best wishes for your journey. truly a classic !!!!"	1
this book seriously makes you think. not only is it suspenseful, it's a teen angst novel, too. it shows you what happens when peer pressure goes too far. the characters are belivable, and sometimes you hate them, and other times, you wish that they're your best friend, especially mark, who later on in the book has a suprise secret that will leave you in a cold sweat. very believable!	1
if that slow, plodding ric burns series on pbs was the official history of new york city, &quot;you must remember this&quot; is the indispensible people's history: actual voices from the turn of the century (the last  century) telling what it was really like to live in the immigrant lower  east side, the hell's kitchen waterfront, jazz-era harlem, the last  stretches of rural inwood. with this and &quot;the box,&quot; kisseloff is  hands-down the most perceptive and consistently fascinating oral historian  i've read, and yes, that's counting studs terkel. buy one for yourself, and  one for a history-lovin' friend. like a trip back in time	1
"by page 7, i was hooked, by page 49, i was ready to write tha author a letter of thanks.     this is not a ""how to be a military wife"" book! if you want to learn how to read an les, go somewhere else.    but, if you want to put the modern military wife into a historical context and see how, sadly, little has changed since the 1940s guides, this is an amazing book.     the author starts with a woman who has lost her navy seal husband, and the casualty notification system. then she moves into stories of living on post/base, long deployments, the expectations put on spouses and their behavior, the economics of military life, domestic abuse, ptsd and the struggle for any form of ""outsider"" or person who may not share the views of the majority in the military.     this book was a welcome breath of fresh air for any military spouse who gets frustrated with the limitations that a military career can often cause for the ""dependent"".     the stories of women are interwoven with research and statistics effortlessly.     again, this is... well, it is an anthropological study of what it is like to be a woman married to an active duty military member in this day and age, with frequent deployments to the middle east, with the political atmosphere in the us being what it is, and the struggle that comes between the three ends of the triangle described in the book. we're supposed to step aside and let uncle sam come first in our marriages... but at what cost?    i think every commander and nco should have this as required reading before they schedule their first frg meeting. thank you karen houppert!"	1
this book mostly skims over our history with not much information other than dates, instead referring you to all kinds of internet websites for the meat. unfortunately, many of the websites no longer exist (although i bought the book almost as soon as it was released), or they just cannot be accessed with the addresses given, so the book is essentially useless. given the life-expectancy of a lot of websites, it hardly seems like a wise concept by barrons for an entire series of books. poor concept/outdated info	0
witnesses to freedom focuses on the efforts and dedication of young african-americans during the civil rights movement.  the stories of protesters as young as nine years old are narrated as well as told through the eyes of the young freedom fighters.  this book highlights not only the more famous young activists that students may not have exposure to, but many young people who did both big and small things to help make the movement.  for example, the book opens with a story about barbara johns, a teenager who led a movement in her school to boycott for better educational facilities and resources.  the book also tells the stories of more famous teenagers like elizabeth eckford who integrated little rock's all white central high, and claudette colvin who was arrested for not giving up her seat to a white person on a montgomery bus months before rosa park's famous arrest.  while the book highlights specific individuals, the stories place a strong emphasis on the importance of group participation for social change.  each young activist was working to inspire others to join the cause, and make the movement truly powerful.  photographs are also included of the young activists which adds a personal touch to their stories of struggle and survival.  this book would be an excellent book to introduce students to the struggle and inspire them to want to learn more about the history of african-americans.  the emphasis on the power of young people to make social change makes this book an excellent resource for children.  this book would be best suited for older children ages 11 and 12.  the book is written in a more mature format, and covers more mature subject matter. witnesses to freedom	1
i myself write westerns, so i bought this book in the hopes that it would help my writings be more accurate.  while the information contained in this book isn't quite as specific as i would have liked, it does have some very interesting and entertaining facts, such as slang terms cowboys used, the terms used for the different hairstyles during the 19th century, and common diseases that plagued the population.  it also lists the different types of horses, which is a tremendous help for me.  if you write novels or are just an avid history buff (of which i am both), then i think you will find this book interesting. somewhat helpful, very interesting	2
this is a horrible, horrible book.  it does not deliver what readers have come to expect from a good romance novel.  first, this novel is full of interesting history that the author does not describe in greater detail.  she is a very poor historian and should concentrate more on the romantic part of the plot.  all she does is confuse the reader with her vaguely described historical events.  second, the male protagonist is mostly unpleasant and often cruel.  very rarely do we see a soft spot in his heart for the heroine.  i was really hoping that there would be a major confession of the &quot;hero's&quot; love for the heroine at the end of the story, especially after the way he treats her throughout the book.  but no.  he never even says the 3 little words we have come to expect at the end (at least) of a good romance novel.  we are just supposed to assume he loves her.  very unfulfilling! third, there are numerous loose ends at the end of the novel.  definitely a book to avoid at all costs. avoid at all cost	0
my 4.5 year old knew his numbers, but when i saw the inside of this book on amazon, i realized that i have not used any technique to build his basics in counting etc., and bought this book    numbers 1-30 starts with simple curve excercises that allow the child to   1. learn drawing curves  2. reading and writing numbers  3. introduces children [ and parents ] to focus on the stroke and the right way to write the numbers.  4. counting as groups and allows build up pattern recognition skills    my son who was used to counting with his finger, now can count in groups by looking at a group of dots. thanks kumon.. i just purchased the next book .. counting 1 to 12. great investment to get started	2
"simply put, this book is the drivel of a man who thinks very highly of himself. it's like being forced to have dinner with your egotistical, drunken uncle. ""blah blah blah... and then  i saved the world and looked good doing it.... blah blah blah... aren't i great?!?!. the pursuit of arrogance"	0
although the book was extremely detailed and thorough, it made me realize that it is impossible to prepare for this exam from this book alone. made me realize not to take the test	2
this book is really geared toward women who are into feminism. all the quotes in the book are from women in her groups. if you're not into the female-identity world, pick another book. too female-centerd	2
when i first saw this book as a kid it really sparked my imagination.  to this day i still get chills when i look at the pictures that speak volumes through mere implication.  allsburg is a visual master with a mind for sharp effective prose, to which this is a testamen. haunting and beautiful	1
yes, it is rubbish.    and some people need to actually... yes, i know this is a revolutionary concept for some lefties... need to actually check out the facts before writing a review or criticizing someone else's review.    this author really is a terrorist.  literally.  it is a matter of public record.  he was a leader of the weather underground terrorist group in the sixties.  his group planted several bombs and blew things up.  to this day he brags about it.  he says he wishes he could have planted even more bombs.  if you don't believe me, read the book he himself wrote about it.  it's available here on amazon.    freakin' morons.. yes it is.	0
i miss old fashioned letters, now that we live in the age of email. frotunately, i still have 'real' letters saved that have now collected dust from my parent's generation, and from a time gone by.    occasionally i stumble over published letters of famous writers in antique bookstores: last time, it was a 800 page volume of some of ernest hemingway's personal letters; the first edition of this amazon edition. they were published posthumeously, and not intended by eh for publication.   we get a peek behind the curtain, and learn among other things that ernest hemingway was addicted to letters, wrote lots and lots, starting in his teens; and that he was really depressed when he didn't receive replies; or when there were days when the postman brought no letters. waiting for transatlantic mail added to his sense of loneliness. letters were a lifelong passion of his, continuing up to the day when he took his own life. these private letters weren't meant to be published, and they are raw, but very honest.   when you read them, you are in no doubt that the writer is a true artist, and an original!  they stretch over the span of his productive life, and they are varied: addressed to family (his parents, his children), his ex, to friends, including famous contemporaries, such as marlene dietrich (just one of them), his agent(s), his publishers, and many more.    i have a hunch eh must have been hard to keep up with, but his letters are fun to read; even though, in my view, his novels are mixed: some great, and some i don't care for.    guess, eh's life was bizare too. the private letters are consistent with that. and yet, they exude a special warmth; both gentelness and passion.  reviewed by palle jorgensen. december 2004. a look behind the curtain!	1
"this book doesn't offer any recommendations for putting any of the advice re: better self-care in place except to suggest perhaps brewing your own coffee at home to save money to hire all the help one needs to make it all a reality. for those of us who already believe ""if mama ain't happy ain't nobody happy"" & set our coffee makers to brew for the morning promptly after getting our babies to sleep for the night, who would like nothing better than a regular date night with our husbands, some quality alone time, and regular refreshing breaks from our kids, this is a frustrating time-waster.      perhaps much of this book's advice is better suited to mothers of older children who have enough disposable income to hire babysitters *and* housekeepers *and* take yoga classes *and* get monthly massages *and* take mini-vacations alone, etc..      the answer, i'm sorry to say (because it is far less satisfactory than blaming mothers for suffering martyrdom complexes & suggesting yoga to help mothers feel more ""balanced"") is a widespread cultural change that makes affordable child care the norm, and helps men & women shoulder the burdens of raising their children more evenly. a much more worthwhile read is ""perfect madness: motherhood in the age of anxiety"" by judith warner.     i give ""the balanced mom"" two stars simply for acknowledging that motherhood is incredibly hard work and those doing that work need to be valued (and value themselves for doing it), which means taking necessary breaks for sustainable self-care. devoid of new, practical information or advice"	2
i like block and rodenbarr and have read many in the series.  this one is a real letdown.  recently authors appear to be having more and more problems bringing their tales to a satisfactory close.  that's true in spades in this book.  at the end the author actually has bernie review what the police will say happened, what really happened, and what could have happened.  it is all jumbled and unintelligible.  the book ends with a classic showdown in a drawing room like some '30's series.  that's no problem but the reader doesn't really know who half the people are or why they are there.  it's just too much confusion for a story that's pretty dull to begin with.  the author does take time to praise bernie's illegal immigrant doorman.  apparently block feels that the high crime rate, astronomical high school drop out rate and appalling illigitimacy rate are nothing compaired with the joy that comes from rich manhattanites being able to find good menial help who know their place.  people don't get much dumber than upper west side liberals. huh?????	2
hunter is an enigma - an assasin by trade, but with a gentleness that is enchanting.  while hunting for food, she witnesses a car accident.  she saves the car's inhabitant.  she later finds out that someone has put a million-dollar contract out on her.  she has no idea who will come after her, why the contract was put on her, or who her mysterious visitor is.    this is not a romance - yes, there is a romance, but it is not the focal point of this novel.  this book is a thriller - an action packed, well written thriller.  baldwin is expert at building the tension from page one to the end of the book.  there will be times when you might want to put the book down because of the tension, but it won't be long before you return to it.  as baldwin builds toward the final confrontation, you will find yourself reading feverishly, and staying up long after you should have turned the lights off.    baldwin shows none of the first-book problems that so many other authors do. in this book, we experience baldwin's considerable writing talents.  one can only imagine that if she is this good with her first book, she will be extraordinary very shortly.    you will certainly want to add baldwin's other two books, force of nature and whitewater rendezvous, to your cart immediately. hunter's pursuit is as good as the genre get	1
i found this book to be dull, pretentious, and without any merit. growing up in the south must have been difficult, but i fail to see what this memoir has to do with anything other than the author showing off his checkered past and large vocabulary.    yaw. this book had nothing to do with being a mentor	2
i have used this book for years.  i lost my copy and am so glad to have it back!  children love to find and count all the dots.  then we make our our dot book. ten black dots...	1
