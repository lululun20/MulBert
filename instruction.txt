1. Create a conda environment for bert
   ```
   conda create --name bert
   conda activate bert
   ```
2. install pytorch using the command from this site:
   https://pytorch.org/
   You need choose the correct configuration, such as python version, cuda version. After that, you can install it by one single command. For example:
   ```
   conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
   ```
3. Install bert
   3.1 Prepare data   
   ```
   mkdir MulBert
   cd MulBert
   mkdir glue_data
   cd glue_data
   mkdir MLSA
   ```
   I have actually create the folders alreadly. You can directly clone the repo in 3.2. But don't forget to name the data correctly and put them in the MLSA folder. 
   Blend all (merge and then randomly shuffle) the training data (in all 7 languages), name it train.tsv and put it in this MLSA folder. 
   Put all the test files in this folder as well and name them in the following fashion:
   en_test.tsv
   fr_test.tsv
   is_test.tsv
   .
   .
   .
   
   3.2 Clone the repo
   Assuming we are now in the MulBert directory,
   ```   
   git clone https://github.com/kinjad/MulBert.git
   ```
   3.3 Install
   ```
   cd transformers
   sudo pip install . (Or sudo pip3 install .)
   ```
   3.4 Run the code
   ```
   cd examples
   ```
   There is one languages.txt file in the examples folder, make sure you modify it according to your languages before you run the code.
   Then
   ```
   ./run_sa.sh
   ```
   This should be able to produce the results.
